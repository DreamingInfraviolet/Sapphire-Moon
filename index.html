<h2 id="prologue">Prologue</h2>

The Gods were standing in the great wasteland of Toras, far out of Ryak's reach, but close, so blissfully close.

Ryak had began the day with prayer, kneeling within his private tent to ask the Gods to grant him strength and courage. They did not reply - they rarely did, not unless the request was of importance and required a response. Instead, he touched the spear stretched out in front of him, and felt the energy seep into his body from the wood, waking him from the deep sleep that the Witch had brought upon him by his behest. He had not dreamt, but some visions were not destined for man.

He stepped outside when dawn began, and lit the torch that had been given to him by the Gods, admiring the flames that would not die as long as there was sunlight. He glanced beyond, and saw the new sacrifice strapped to a heap of straw and wood, secured by hempen ropes. The sacrifice did not scream - to scream against the Gods was an offence. Instead he lay there calmly, his eyes closed, as if in sleep, though none of them ever slept. He was surrounded by a ring of flowers that seemed to burn in the early sunlight, their strange textures capturing the sun's magnificence exactly. Around the ring stood seven figures - likely family and friends.

Ryak approached the scene ceremoniously, spear in one hand and the torch extended in the other. Thirteen eyes were watching him. Some of those were crying, but most withheld their tears. Ryak spoke the required words, and dropped the torch into the pyre, making the sign of the Seal after he did so. One of the watchers burst out weeping, but the sacrifice did not scream as the flames caressed his skin. His place was above the Necrosea, and one who knew that had only cause to rejoice.

After the daily rite was completed, Ryak turned his back to both the sun and the fire, and beheld the army gathered before him, thousands upon thousands of men and women armed with spears and bows. They wore the red uniform associated with his clan - cloth stained in the blood of the slain. Some were yet dressed in grey, not having proved their worth as soldiers. All stood lined facing the Gods in the distance, prepared to charge at the faintest order.

His gaze shifted to the spectacle beyond - beyond the men, beyond the desert, beyond the hot shimmering air. There stood the great black mountain of Toras, its shape looming impossibly by the horizon - strange peaks that he had not seen on any other mountains. Its edges were sharp, its surface impossibly black, yet reflecting the opposing sun like cold lake water. Above it swirled a colossal vortex of pitch black clouds, disturbed only by strange lightning - lightning that failed to die, instead hanging in the air forever, flexing like the ripples of a broken pond. A hum could be heard from the direction - they have heard it for the last three morns, always in the distance, and now it was closer than ever, tearing at the air with perceivable power.

<i>And thus we rise.</i>

He strode towards his post as the chief of the clan at the front of the army, waiting for silence. They have been waiting for this battle for countless moons, praying and training for strength. <em>He</em> had waited from when the Gods first came upon the land, accepting their meagre gifts with genuine gratitude as his mind plotted on how one might destroy a God. The final day of waiting was at last at an end as mountain stood before them in its unnatural beauty. From this day on, their clan would forever be known as Those Who Slew The Gods, becoming gods themselves in the process.

Ryak held up a hand, and the quiet air diminished into deadly silence, thousands of eyes staring upon him with expectation. He had gathered them to be prepared by dawn, and thus they were, obedient to his every command. Those who were not have been sacrificed over the years, leaving only the most pure of followers.

"Hear me, my brothers and sisters," he began, his arms raised as he addressed his followers. "Today we have come to do what no clan before us had dared to do. When the Gods have come to the earth, giving out their trinkets and promising hidden knowledge, all the other tribes - they were content. They were content with the Gods who gave them children's toys, keeping the true gifts to themselves for fulfilling their own selfish desires. They were content when the Gods refused to put an end to the earth tremours that they have plagued us with for hundreds of years, and they were content when the Gods cursed our homes with the Eternal Drought for the misdeeds of our ancestors.

"We are no cowards, which is why we are <em>not</em> content. It is time that we rose up from the mud in which they put us, from the misery that they have brought upon our lives. We must act now, before they ascend once more into the Otherworld, and escape the crimes that they have commited. And through acting, we shall absolve them of their reponsibilities, and become Gods ourselves!"

What began as a loud speach soon turned into shouting, and at the last sentence a cheer arose from the crowd. Spears crashed into the ground in a salute, and Ryak knew that his people required no more motivation.

"Attack!" He shouted, raising his own spear high above his head. "And spare neither the God nor the Man who stands on our path!"

And with that his army charged, sprinting towards the mountain of Toras with a fierce war cry practiced endlessly in past victories. Ryak ran with them, his legs carrying him before the others with ease. The heat was burning from above, but he was accustomed to it to the point of not perceiving it at all. His breath came rhythmically with each step, as he had practiced in his childhood, though the battle cry behind him overwhelmed the sound of his own breath. He did not join in - sound needed energy, but so did the slaying of Gods.

As Ryak ran, the mountain slowly grew in front of him, the vortex above it swirling ever closer above them. They started their attack at a great distance, for he knew that the Gods would not permit them to make camp too close to Toras. His people would not tire - they have trained too much to be swayed by running.

Before long, the mountain was nearly upon them. Ryak stared as he ran, admiring the streams of power surging along its surface. It was almost ethereal, not belonging to this world. It was higher than any mountain he had ever known, and as he approached he saw that it did not merge seamlessly into the ground like normal mountains did. Instead it seemed to go <em>through</em> the ground, surrounded by a fissure leading down into the earth. Soon he began seeing the strange irregularities of the surrounding sand, displaced by the immesurable force of the Gods.







<h2 id="chapter1">Chapter 1</h2>
The warm wind caressed her hair, brushing gently against her skin as it made its way through the surrounding grass. The smell of flowers filled the air. Flowers have sprung up all over and around the village, more so than they ever had before, and traces of them were omnipresent in the surrounding woodlands. Bees busied themselves gathering pollen all around as the occasional fly passed nearby. The distant sound of a river could be heard, although only a trained ear could distinguish the rushing water from the rustling of the leaves.

Hesanna lay among the grass, picking some of the flowers beside her and weaving them into an elaborarte wraith. The colours were red and yellow and white - some of her favourites. As she lay there she squinted at the clouds every few minutes, curious of the forms they assumed. It occured to her how many of the clouds looked like celestial landscapes, perhaps places where heroes would go to slay the next dragon. She was deeply happy for once, far away from the worries that plagued her daily, from the duties imposed on her. Lost deeply in her mind where nothing disturbed her.

She closed her eyes momentarily, taking a deep breath to smell the richness of the air once more, feeling the sun opon her skin.

"Hesanna, have you harvested the carrots? Hesanna!" The voice cut through the hot evening like a sword of ice, making the dishevelled girl jump up in surprise. "Hesanna? What have you been <em>doing</em>?"

The girl look at her mother with wide eyes, concealing the half finished wraith of flowers that was in her hands. She hesitated upon seeing the stern expression directed at her, and looked down in shame. "No. I haven't."

"I have told you to gather them <em>two hours</em> ago. Do you really want us to starve for the winter? We can't let the blight take 'em, please the Divines!" The woman stared at her daughter for a brief instance scornfully, her brow creased in a deep wrinkly frown. Suddenly, in a brief flash of fury and frustration, she strode towards her and snatched the wraith from her hands, crumpling it as she did so. "Don't you <em>understand</em>? Your father and I are toiling to keep you from starving, while you . . . you lie around doing <em>this</em>!" She shook the wreath in front of her demonstratively. "Explain yourself!"

Hesanna did not reply, standing in silence unable to meet her mother's gaze. Finally she said, "I will harvest them now."

"Yes you will," came the unsympathetic retort. "You will have no more food for today. You must learn that food must be earned, or else you'll starve before the moon is full once more. Go on then! If these carrots are not gathered by sundown, you will not eat until they are."

With that the woman strode off, ripping the flower wreath as she went back towards the house to leave a trail of crumpled petals. She did not look back as she disappeared into the small doorframe.

Hesanna stood there for a moment, her hands trembling. Her day has been going so well - she managed to sleep more than usual, which broke the streak of sleepless nights that have haunted her for the last three days. There were rumours of a sleeping sickness sweeping through the village, and she could only hope that this was the end of it for her. When her mother ordered her to go to the fields again, she was struck by the unusual beauty of the flowers that opened themselves up to face the sun. Her mother called them weeds, but she could not agree. So had decided to lay down in the grass for a little, gathering the flowers under the welcoming sun and thinking about the lands beyond.

And then her mother came. Her attitude as sour as ever.

Hesanna opened her eyes, and hurried to gather the carrots before she could be seen idling again. She picked one up, pulling it out of the ground with both hands, and frowned. The carrot has been thoroughly eaten by critters, only a narrow core remaining. She set it aside anyway, expecting that it would suffice for some soup. The rest of the carrots were a little better, although none were left entirely spared. It had not rained much recently, so the crop was not the healthiest to begin with. Sighing, she moved to the next set of carrots.

Why must her parents make life so mundane, she wondered. Part of her understood the necessities of life - that one had to toil daily in order to survive. But she had heard stories of heroes who spent their entire lives adventuring, fighting unimaginable creatures to protect the world from their evil. In the stories they rarely had to work on the fields. Her mother said not to fill her head with such nonsense, but she loved hearing the occasional travellers tell the tales that they have picked up on their journeys. Sometimes at night she imagined that she was such a traveller, roaming the world together with its wonders and not being bound to the same dull plot of land for her entire life. Her mother took pride in their land, saying that it was the second biggest in the village. Apparently it had been passed down through a dozen generations, absorbing a few of the neighbouring plots throughout the years through marriage.

She pulled another carrot, noting the black spots that covered it before throwing it away. She had asked her father once about the travellers, wondering whether the tales they told were true. She had for a long time known that men can lie with very little motivation, even if only to provide an entertaining show. He was a hunter who sold most of his catch at the village market, and had to be able to detect lies to avoid being tricked by some of the less reputable inhabitants. He told her curtly that they were liars the whole lot of them, and she should not pay attention to their drivel.

Hesanna did wonder though. Some of the travellers spoke of a great kingdom in the south, where giant creatures with long snouts transported kings and armies of solid gold walked the plains. The said that there was no grass there, nor were there trees. Instead, the ground was a yellow sea of dust that moved when no one was there to watch. According to them, the only way to reach this kingdom was to walk across this sea. A sea was like a lake, she was told, but infinite. She had never seen such places herself, and doubted that they could exist exactly how the travellers described them. Some said that skeletons roamed those lands, hunting down the unprepared and taking their flesh for their own to pass as living beings. Hesanna shivered. Despite her fear, she hoped to someday venture from their land to explore. She might not feel ready to be a hero, but she could not bear the thought of having to spend the rest of her life locked within a square.

By the time she finished gathering all the carrots, two hours have passed, and it took another two hours to take all the carrots to the basement of the house and sort them according to how badly they were damaged. When she was done, she came outside to find the sun already near the horizon - a red circle that cast long, dark shadows over the ground. She went inside again and told her mother that she was done. News which were received with a disapproving shake of the head and cold porridge for dinner.

She went to sleep that night thinking more about the story of the travellers, trying to differentiate lies from reality like her father might. She found it very difficulty, though. She had never ventured outside her village for more than a few miles. Sleep finally came with those thoughts, and she dreamt of nothingness.





<h2 id="chapter2">Chapter 2</h2>

<i>Floating . . . floating . . . . Who am I? These forms, why do they move . . . . The world, so sweet . . . please, once more.</i>
<i>Ariana.</i>

Slowly the memories returned to her, one by one. The first thing that returned was the realisation that she existed, and was alive. She felt as if she had spent her entire life drifting in a boundless void, knowing no life other than the surrounding blackness. For how long has she been floating among the swirling gases that intruded into her solitude? Surely it was no less than innumerable aeons, a duration too large for her to envision. What was she? She existed. That's what mattered most. She existed . . . . 

Over time, another force became pronounced, waiting for her just out of sight, glowing a fiery red that beat in rhythm with her heart - she had a heart - and seemed to grow ever fainter with each beat. Has it been there forever? No. It was not there before. Change . . . what was change? She could not remember. <i>Deepflower and roses</i>. The world shuddered violently, and she screamed without words, a pain that clutched at her tender thougts and ripped them to shreds. And in an instant, it was gone.

She chose not to think any more. Thinking brought the Red pulse. <i>Please not that . . . </i>. So she floated once again, content to observe the flickering beacons of light as they danced purposelessly across her vision, dying and being reborn in an endless cycle.

It took her two years to realise that the shapes have disappeared, forever dying out like monochrome flames that tried to burn underwater. <i>Am I dying?</i> It was strange to think that the world she had inhabited her entire life could ever leave her, for what could possibly be on the other side?

Another decade passed before she remembered anything else. She was a . . . human, wasn't she? A moment of concentration solidified the idea. A human. A . . . <i>she</i>. She did not belong here. She tried to find a body, anything to hold onto, and felt a strange sensation - something . . . was touching her. Something hard at her side. Perhaps . . . <i>the ground?</i> Probing further, she opened her mouth.

"I . . . . Am Ariana," a voice croaked, although that was mostly her imagination - her throat was far too dry to give rise to words. She tried to open her eyes. <i> Eyes . . . </i>. She was returning. Nothing happened - the world remained pitch black. Fatigued, she lay there for a moment, twitching involuntarily. Her mouth worked soundlessly, though she was not trying to speak. She tried to raise herself, but the attempt made her vomit violently somewhere beside her, and it took the last of her strength to lie back down before the world once more was lost in a spiral of sickening haze.

The second time she woke, the blackness was replaced with the colour of blood. She forced her eyelids open, wincing at the bright light for a few minutes before she her eyes finally remained open. Everything was blurry for a few minutes, and it took her a while to realise that what she was looking at was a network of dead, leafless tree branches above her. She tried to sit up cautiosly, the memory of the last attempt faint in her brain, but thankfully this time she succeeded.

Looking around, Ariana found herself in a dense forest with no sign of civillisation in sight. While the trees were dead, the view was thoroughly obstructed by immense bushes that sprouted from the humus-covered ground. She rested for ten minutes before daring to rise to her feet, and at last did so unsteadily, almost falling. Dead plant material fell off her as she stood up, and she brushed some off her weakly. Touching her face, she began to realise how filthy her appearance must be. She was coated with a layer of dirt that would take a while to wash off, that much was obvious.

What had happened to her? She could not recall . . . . Suddenly the faint memory of perfume came back to her, of an old woman offering her a vial, of a drop of blood and a prince coming to saver her. She was not sure what to make of the memoroes . . . . They were very faint, as if they have happened a million years ago to someone else and were injected into her. She looked down at herself, and saw that she was wearing an enbroidered scarlet garment fit for a queen, a strange sign decorating her left shoulder.

It was then that a realisation came to her - she did not know who she was.
She had no memory of anything prior to waking up. The clothes she was wearing indicated nobility, far too finely made even for the middle class. Yet she had no memories of riches or leisure, no more than she could remember working in a field or as a servant to a lord. The probed her mind, and found a knowledge of politics, of literature, of different nations. This knowledge far exceeded what she could say about milking cows, so she deduced that her assumption was correct.

The most pungent memory, however, was that of the smell of perfume. A perfume so powerful that she could almost sense it in the air as she tried to recall further, a sense of deep regret and longing stirring deep within.

Gasping, Ariana forced the memory as far away from her as possible, for underneath the pleasure came an underrunning sense of dread. There was something strange about that memory, and she had every intention to keep it confined until she knew enough to understand what it meant.

Her main goal right now was to leave this forest, and she could not afford to sit around thinking until she knew that she safe from thirst and starvation.

Looking around one last time to make sure that there was nothing she missed, she peered at the sky to try to determine the sun and guess the time of day. Thick clouds greeted her, but after a moment Ariana believed that she knew where the sun way, which hinted at the direction she should take. What land was she in? She could not remember . . . . But she knew it not to be Azkaran - otherwise she would have dried in the heat long ago before being eaten by the vultures. That meant she was either north or south of it, but this was of little use.

Ariana frowned helplessly at the strange predicament - it was as if something had eradicated all traces of her past self but did not care to remove all of her other memoriers.

Sighing, she turned to what she imagined must be north - a conclusion supported by the moss covering the trees - and began to walk, identifying a relatively clear passage that should ease the progress. There were no footsteps to be found, and it was not guaranteed that she was near a settlement. But she could not hear anything in the distance aside from the wind and the occasional birds, and had no wish to walk around in circles until she died of thirst. There was no particular reason to go north, but it was a better than to stay, and it would help avoid accidental backtracking.

Dusk came soon that day, confirming that it was indeed north that she was walking. Ariana found a clearance on the ground and lay there, wishing to proceed but unable to see in the darkness. At last sleep overcame her, 





<h2 id="chapter3">Chapter 3</h2>

It was the following day that Hesanna was to learn of the marriage.

"We are marrying you to Dane Quarry's second son," her mother said simply. There had been no warning, no consent. It was as if an absolute truth was uttered that was not to be challenged. Hesanna had woken that morning, eaten breakfast, and within moments her parents were in the room to confront her about what they had to say. "They live on the opposite side of the village. <em>He</em> lives, and I'll be expecting you to live with him after the marriage. The wedding is in three weeks, so you won't have to wait long. At your age, we are lucky that anyone is willing to marry you. Seventeen is hardly the age of a maiden." Her father was standing in the room scrutinising her reaction. He was not a man to take lightly to disobediance, and when she looked at him, his expression demanded complete sub ordinance.

"Please, I am not ready to marry! You can't . . . ."

"We can do as we choose fit, you ungrateful brat. While you have been wasting time, me and your father have been busy proving you with a safe and steady future. Show some respect for once."

"But I don't know this person. Why him?" Hesanna whispered. She was not truly sure what to say. She had not expected marriage . . . not even really thought about it before. Her parents mentioned it a number of times per year, but none of the boys in the village ever showed much interest in her, not she in them. The last thing that she would want was to be married off to someone she did not love.

"His family has wealth, why else. We want you to have a secure future, which is why we have come to the decision. The village council approves, so it is a good match." Her mother calmed a little, hints of love showing through the heat of her usual tone. "'Haps you won't have to work the fields all your life. Birth him a son, say - we'll have grandchildren, and you can look after them and cook and won't need to sully those pretty hands of yours. Isn't that what you always wanted? To lay around Divines know how long, with your head in the clouds and your feet in the air? We might as well put that to some good use. One hears 'tis good attitude for the babe, though I'll be sure to knock some sense into him when he is old enough to work. 'Tis for the best, child."

"Can I meet him at least? I just . . . I don't want to marry someone I don't know. I barely even heard of the Quarry's!"

"You will not see him," came the response, as cold as before. "It is back luck for a bride to see her future husband before marriage. We have made the decision, and you will follow if you want to have a roof over your head. You just choose which roof that is, child."

They did not allow her to reply, instead giving her a list of chores for the day and leaving with the knowledge that she'll do as she was told assuming she was hungry. The rest of her day was spent in a daze, not entirely able to believe the conversation that had just transpired. She fetched the water from the well, fed the animals, broomed the floors collected potato beetles and harvested some of the grains, as she did every day. When she was done she ate a meal in silence, consisting of a loaf of bred and cheese together with fresh milk. Ordinary activities, yet they assumed a strange hue throughout the day, for a single thought that remained resident in her mind.

By the time night came, Hesanna was more tired than usual. Yet she could not sleep. She could hardly imagine herself marrying one of the local boys. How could she ever leave the place if she was married and with children? The thought left her feeling nauseous. She knew that some of the other village girls wanted to marry - in fact, many were already married at this point, and some have born a child. But they were not interested in exploring, and the only thing they found more interesting than the travellers' stories were their looks. If she married, she would be bound to the village for a long time. She had planned to leave someday. Is that really not to be?

A sudden realisation startled her. <em>Someday</em>. She thought for a moment about her life, about her plans. Would she have ever truly left? Did anyone ever plan to stay in the village their entire lives? Some did surely, but many likely failed to plan to leave instead. She clutched her pillow at the discomforting thought. Dreams of leaving are just that - dreams - if they are not acted upon. Had she actually ever intended to leave with one of the travellers? Not that most would let her - many supplied themselves only for reaching the next town or village, and did would not want to take up a stray villager. But did she have the strength to leave everything that she had ever known?

Suddenly anger fired through her, sending tears to her eyes. Her parents had controlled her throughout her entire life, but she was tired. Was a little novely in life truly so much to ask for? And now her parents intended to rid her of her only dream. Part of her knew that she would have to accept her fate . . . . Or flee.

Wiping her eyes, the girl rose from her bed, and walked out. Their family was wealthy enough to own a house that had more than one room - unlike most of what her peers had to live in - so she did not worry about waking anyone. She opened the door, and closed it gently behind her once she was outside. The cool breeze of the night wind swept through her face, her cheeks suffusing with the blissful coolness. The heat in her eyes slowly passed, and she made her way behind the house. The way was illuminated with the light blue glow of the moon, and she could easily make out the path that led through the trees concealing the horizon. The path was familiar, so she did not stumble in the darkness.

It took her two minutes to reach a clearing in the trees. Hesanna lay down among the tall grass and turned her head to face the full moon. It was partially obscured by clouds, but most of the sky was clear, bright stars decorating the rest of the sky. The grass was cool against her skin, blades poised to cut yet harmless. It might have been wet on any other night, but the last few days saw little rain. The sound of crickets filled the air, piercing the sound of rustling leaves with surprising harshness.

Hesanna closer her eyes, and thought.





<h2 id="chapter4">Chapter 4</h2>

Ariana walked for one day and one night until she finally found a source of water.

Ever after she had woken, she had been desperately thirsty to the point of barely being able to speak. Her state had improved considerably overall - she was no longer delirious, though no other memories returned to her, and the dizziness slowly left her to be replaced with a cold determination to survive. It felt as if she had been asleep for centuries, yet when she slept for the first night, she was glad to rest. Her body still seemed to be recovering from whatever had happened to her.

Perhaps she would regain her memories when she fully recovered, and all would be revealed in a grand epiphany. For some reason she doubted it, though. Ariana had searched her mind for hours as she walked, only occasionally resurfacing to inspect her environment and ensure that she was not walking in circles. Lost as she was, there are always roads if one walks far enough in a straight line. She had noticed something strange in her introspection, though. There were some thoughts that when she approached them, trying to concentrate, her head was seized in a throbbing headache which did not release until she surrendered the mental expedition. It would have felt as if her mind is hiding something from her, something it thought she was not yet ready to see, were it not for one realisation - she knew that there was nothing where those memories should be. Those areas of her mind . . . They were not gone, she realised. They have been simply replaced. She remembered years - centuries, even - of floating in darkness - an image that came readily with the headache. <i>Thud, thud, thud.</i>

<i>The Red Pulse.</i>

The Red Pulse is what she found now, all over her mind. It stopped pulsing, but whatever it touched, was gone. She hoped desperately that some event would prove her wrong, but inside, she knew. Part of her knew.

A single tear rolled down her face, to be wiped away immediately with a curse. So what if her memories were gone. What did it matter. "I am still myself," she said out loud, wincing at the dryness of her throat. "The past does not define me. <em>Can not</em> define me."

True statements. She just did not have a choice.

She continued on in silence.

It was about two hours of walking until she began to discern anything other than the chirping of birds and the wind rushing through the barren trees. Somewhere in the distance she thought she could make out rushing water, and her eyes sprung wide open with reinvigouration. Speeding up her pace, she walked towards the sound, navigating through the thickening bushes with increasing speed. All worries were forgotten in a flurry of leaves and branches. <i>Finally, water.</i>

Suddenly, without warning, she was by the water, its blue water a reflection of the sky disturbed by innumerable ripples. She fell down on her knees, and washed her face hurriedly before lowing her head to drink. The taste was more refreshing than she could imagine, the wetness a welcome change from the dirt covering her face. Before she knew it she could drink no more, so she lay down and rested on a grass patch beside the gravel lining the river, making sure to first remove the thorny bush leaves that were ubiquitous in the forest. She lay there until her face and hands had dried, listening to the water as it streamed precariously northwest.

She should follow the river, Ariana knew. Where there was water, there were people, and settlements. They would accept her as a noble, and supply her with housing and food. Once she had recovered more, she could tell her story, and ask for assistance. They could help her find out who she was, and reunite her with her family. . . .

Assuming she had a family, that is. She had the desire to reunite with one, so she imagined that meant that she must have had one. The desire must have come from somewhere. While she could not directly recall anything of her past life, she seemed to be able to pick out hints from feelings that had survived the Red Pulse, as she had come to call it. The Pulse seemed to be very selective in what it had destroyed - and she knew that it had destroyed - as she could remember <em>everything</em> except what directly related to her life. It seemed far too . . . intentional for her comfort. Once she found out what happened, the perpetrator would suffer greatly, that was one thing Ariana was sure of. Her teeth grit at the thought, so she pushed it away, and closed her eyes.

Ariana rose from the ground after some more rest and thought until she began feeling drowsy. She did not want to sleep - hunger was beginning to show, and a settlement could not have been far. So she drank some more and took off her garment to bathe and wash the dirt from herself. She felt justified in worrying that no one would accept her for a nobel if they could not distinguish between her and one of the mud people from the First Tellings. Afterwards she washed the red garment that she had, and left it to dry a little before putting it on again. Ariana was surprised at the brilliance of the fabric - it seemed to almost glow a profound scarlet, reflecting the sunlight off its surface. It reminded her of velvet, but was far too strong and durable to be such. Her boots were of the same colour, equally well made. She guessed the clothes to be very expensive, suitable for a Greater Lord or even an Emperor - although the latter was probably an exaggeration. She wondered how she had acquired it, but did not pursue the thought much further.

Once she was done, the girl paused for a moment, and bent down to look her reflection in the water. Brown eyes, black hair, tanned skin . . . that much was obvious. Not much else seemed notable to her. She did not know what people of the north (or south) looked like, so she could not judge whether she was from these lands. She imagined that she must have been - why would anyone carry her long distances only to leave her in a forest - but she could not be certain. The only people she knew to look exceptionally different were the tribespeople of Ulk, with their elongated ears and charred crocodile skin and needles sprouting from their spines, but she was certain she was not one of them herself.

Rising once more, she started walking along the river, meaning to follow it until she found someone who could help her. Out of the corner of her eye she saw a fish in the water. Ariana did not think she knew how to cook . . . and was not sure whether she could swim, so she stored the observation in case she would not be able to find other sources of food first. She felt particularly inclined not to die until she knew what had happened to her.

With that, the girl with the black hair resumed her journey once more, and did not stop even in the darkness of the following night with the sound of water to guide her.





<h2 id="chapter5">Chapter 5</h2>

The next day Hesanna did not argue - something that relaxed her mother somewhat. She woke early in the morning, broke her fast in silence, and tried to nod as timidly as she could muster when her mother came and told her that they have had a dress made for the looming occasion. She was made to try it on, and despite being a little tight the dress was relatively comfortable. It was plain and unadorned, with yellow fringes serving as the only decoration, yet many girls had to do with less for their wedding ceremonies. It was common practice to rent a dress in the village, but her mother had said that the renting family no longer provided the service because of some family grievance before denouncing the foolishness of such a decision. <i>Coin was coin</i>, she said, <i>and they'll find many more grievances when they starve to death</i>.

Hesanna almost felt guilty as she put away the dress and folded it neatly as she listened about the chores to be done for the day. She knew that she would not have the opportunity to wear that dress again, although that was not what bothered her. The guilt rose more from the conviction in her mother's voice that she was going to the wedding, and a strange gleam in her eyes that she had rarely seen before - was it love, perhaps? Or happiness?

Regardless, Hesanna had the weakness of not being able to maintain anger for long. As she set out to do her chores, she briefly considered to go through with the wedding even if it meant confinement to the village. After all, would the local safety not be preferable to the rumoured uncertainty of travel and the dangers associated with it? She cursed herself as soon as the idea came. Her parents would be happy if she married, but she was not prepared to abandon her dreams for the sake of her parents and a child. Even if that implied taking a risk.

The rest of her day went as normal - four hours working in the fields, feeding the cattle, hauling more water from the well. All things that she had done hundreds of times before, utterly familiar in their simplicity. Yes as the day before, a new feeling was lodged within her chest - this time, of fear and excitement. This made it more difficult for her to behave normally, being partly consumed by the emotion, but that could easily be explained by feigning expectation of the wedding.

Once evening came, Hesanna ate the porridge given to her gratefully, and thanked her mother for the meal. In truth she was tired of porridge - the taste having faded into bitterness many years ago. But that was not something she thought she should openly admit. Afterwards she washed her face at the water basin outside, and went to her room to sleep on the bedding laid out for her on the floor. She thought that her family had beds at some point, but those have been sold off long ago during a brief famine. She closed her eyes.

But did not sleep.

The girl observed with a racing heartbeat as the light behind her eyelids faded from a dull red to a the blue that came from the moonlight shining through her narrow window. The night seemed cloudless once again, Hesanna thought with a relieved sigh. Clouded, the darkness outside would have been impenetrable even to the most keen of sight. She turned unconfortably, trying to control her breathing. She lay there until she was certain that her parents were sleep, and then she lay for two hours more just to be absolutely certain. She would have stayed for longer if she did not know that doing so would mean she'd never leave. There was no point in waiting any longer - the time has come.

Hesanna slowly pushed away the woolen blanket that had covered her, and gently lifted herself into a standing position before taking her boots and putting on the coat that she had brought to her room between. She paused to listen, hearing nothing, and placed some of the few other clothes she owned into a sack, moving as silently as she could. At last she was standing in front of the door that separated her room from the rest of the house, and twisted the wooden doorknob, wincing at the creak it made. She might have fled through the window, but it was by far too small for anyone to squeeze through. She stepped through, and closed the door with equal care, lest the wind pick up and slam it against the wall.

The common room was as empty as it had been last night, though then she had been calm and determined - this time panic was threatening to overwhelm her. She stood for a moment before starting for the exit, when a gleam of moonlight caught her attention in the corner of her eye. There, mounted on the wall, hung her father's oddly shaped sword that she heard him call a Hanabaskar scimitar. He said that he had taken it from a looter two decades ago during a great house fire, though it was more likely that he had purchased it from one of the visiting caravans as her mother always insisted. He stored it there as one of his prized objects, displayed in the open not only as a signal to any guests whom he deemed suspicious, but also for quick access it provided in case the house needed protection. Hesanna had always resisted the urge to note how an intruder could just as easily get to the blade and use it against him.

Should she take it? Out in the wild, she would be left unprotected, with anyone and any<i>thing</i> having an instant advantage over her. The thought of stealing made her uncomfortable. She was already taking the promise of grandchildren - should she truly take any more? A moment of contemplation, however, gave her the answer. No hero was without her sword, much like no farmer lived without a plough. Taking a deep breath, she slowly walked towards the sword, finding it strange how the moonlight fell directly onto it as if it something was beckoning her to do the deed.

She lay her hand on the hilt of the scimitar, caressing the woven metal fabric. Hours seemed to have passed, though it could have not been longer than a minute. Suddenly self conscious of how long she had spent in the common room by now, she laid a second hand onto the scabbard with nervous determination, and gently lifted it off the wall.

Hesanna had not realised that she had been holding her breath the entire time - so when a piece of metal fell from behind the sheath to crash loudly against the wooden floor, the audible gasp that came from her lips was an utter and complete surprise. Her heart pounding, she turned around to listen briefly, though it was hard to hear beyond the blood pushing against the inside of her skull.

She walked to the exit as quickly as she could without making any noise, and in a blink she was at the wooden door, fumbling at the keyhole with a trembling hand. At last she heard a familiar <i>click</i>, and turned the handle handle gently, cracking the door open just enough for her to be able to slip through. Hesanna squeezed through, careful not to bang at the wood with any of her belongings as she did so before closing the door once again. Her parents would notice the opened lock, but by that time she should be far away beyond their influence.

Smelling the night air a little made her relax a little, though only barely. She was still shaking, wondering whether the sound had woken anyone. What was it anyway? Was it a piece of metal placed there to guard against intruders? She could hardly tell, although it would have been a wonder if anyone slept through that crashing noise.

She needed to hurry, Hesanna knew.The main part of the escape was yet to happen, and she had not planned it as well as she felt she should have. What if someone from the village recognised and stopped her? The village was south of the house - the direction in which she wanted to go. The first idea that came to mind was to go west at first towards the river, before following it south. Keeping close to the river though would guarantee an encounter with one of the night hunters from the village, some of which were friends with her father and would recognise her and the sword. So instead she chose to go east until the town was out of sight, and then turn south before finding the river at a safe distance. The night hunters did not travel far, and during the day only peddlers and travellers should be found where she hoped to reach, and even that was an overstatement. Not many people travelled - in a week, Hesanna imagined that at most four people left or approached the village, the vast majority of them being newcommers who would not recognise her. The logic calmed her a little - she should be safe before the night was over.

At that, the girl turned east, the direction in which the front of the house pointed, and began walking hurriedly towards one of the thick bushes that helped separate their territory from the muddy road that led to the village. <i>Their territory. No longer our territory</i>, she thought. Under one of the more secluded bushes lay a cache of carrots and cabbage and lettuce and cheese - all the food that she was able to prepare during the day without arousing suspicion. She placed the food into her bag, and began walking back to the road while trying not to make any more noise among the leaves.

It was when she was already at the gate that the door behind her burst open loudly and a screaming figure emerged into the open. The figure was yet in the shadows, but the voice was unmistakably that of her father.

"Thieves and scoundrels! Merta, wake up, Merta! We are being robbed by one of the local scoundrels!"

Hesanna did not stay to hear more, jumping over the small gate before she was aware of what she was doing. She did not know for how long she had run, but her only memory of what happened next was that of blurred desaturated colours rushing past her in an indecipherable stream of branches and leaves. She could remember her biting against her skin as she sped past, scratching her hands as she protected her face from the worst, though there had been no pain. She must have ran through the forest, either too afraid or too cautious to stay on the road. Her father had chased her for a good five minutes before giving up, unable to catch up even despite the load she was carrying. He screamed the entire time, calling her a thief and a scoundrel and a worm of the earth, though she did not know whether he recognised her under the moonlight. The look she gave him lasted no longer than a split second before her better judgement carried her away.

By the time she stopped running, Hesanna was utterly exhausted, bleeding from thorns that she had run through as she was escaping from her father. She collapsed somewhere between tall bushes, unable to continue much further, colours throbbing in her vision with each passing heartbeat. By the time she calmed, tears were streaming down her face, interrupted by spasmodic sobs.

<i>Is this how it is like to be a hero?</i> She wondered. Then, darkness.





<h2 id="chapter6">Chapter 6</h2>

As the days passed, the sceneary around Ariana slowly changed until it was entirely different from what she had woken up to when her new life began. The myriad of dead trees and thorny bushes slowly gave way to pines and harmless shrubbery, and the weather seemed to brighten as well. It was a welcome change - it had been cold at first, and she did not have any additional clothes to protect herself. Now the sun shone at her back, lighting the scene beyond her like a thousand torches never would.

By that point she had realised that she was somewhere in the north. The angle of the sun as it swept through the sky hinted that she was a fair distance from the equator, and combined with the direction of the sun, she had a basic idea of where she was located. This did not help much, as she still had no place to go, but it was comforting not to be entirely disoriented.

Counting the days, she thought she must have been walking for five days now. She found the occasional berries and fruit, carrying as many as she could with her, but overall her hunger had intensified. There were some animals that showed themselves from time to time, and of course the everpresent fish, but she felt that hunting them would require more effort than the food was worth. She did not have any hunting equipment or weapons, which made the task just so much more difficult.

Sighing, Ariana resorted to concentrating on her breath, taking one step at a time. Her legs were very tired - she did not think that she had walked much in her past life. There was no trace of a settlement, as she had initially hoped, and the waters were too turbulent to allow any boat safe passage. She occasionally searched for signs of human occupation - tracks, fences, smoke - but nothing presented itself. One night she thought she could hear the howling of wolves in the distance, but each time the sound came it was softer than before, more distant. She could only hope that nothing of danger decided to head her way.

By the eight day, desperation was veiling over Ariana. She had not been able to find any food for the last couple of days, and the reflection in the water was more gaunt than it had ever been before. She knew that she had to find a settlement, or starvation was inveitable. She had tried catching some of the fish in the river, but they evaded her effortlessly until she gave up after a few hours of splashing. Was she to die there? <i>Yes</i>, she imagined. She was.

It was on the ninth day when she saw the figure in the distance.

At first she thought that it must be an apparition, or human-looking bush. It was not until she came much closer that the shape could be clearly seen moving towards her. Part of her wanted to flee, to hide in the bushes until the stranger was gone, but she pushed the thought aside. Ariana could not afford to waste possibly her only opportunity for survival due to fear. It was true that the person in front of her could as easily be a bandit, walking towards her to take whatever they thought she must have had on her, but . . . was death by starvation truly a worse alternative to a dagger? She shuddered at the thought. She had to risk it, exposing herself to the possible danger. The stranger likely saw her by now, so if they were truly a bandit only agility and luck would have saved her - things that she seemed to lack of late.

Pursing her lips, Ariana stalked forward, staring intently at the stranger as she walked.

It was then that she noticed the long, thin sliver of light reaching from the hand of the figure - a sword. Ariana's breath froze, her heart sinking. <i>So this is how it ends after all, isn't it.</i> As her legs carried her forward, she was able to observe the strange curved form of the metal. <i>Not a sword, a scimitar.</i> The realisation brought a sudden discomfort that she could not place.

Finally she was close enough to able to make out the face of the stranger.

It was a girl, close to her age, looking more frightened than Ariana felt.

"Who are you!" The girl yelled, sword clumsily in hand.

"I am . . . Ariana," was the calm reply. Ariana was surprised at herself - how was she able to command such calmness in the face of danger? It did not matter for the moment, so she stored the thought for later.

"I am not going to hurt you," said the girl, waving her scimitar as if to bring home the point. "I just need to ask some questions."

"Who are you." Ariana's fear slowly subsided, and she felt a newfound determination that she did not feel before on her journey.

"I . . . . Why? You're not going to tell anyone at the village you saw me, will you?"

"Village?" She raised an inquisitive eyebrow. "What village?"

"You mean . . . . The village that lies further down this river. Isn't that where you were going?"

Ariana decided that she was, and said the same. If this girl was telling the truth, her quest might have finally been over, even if only temporarily. She could rest at last, and enquire about her identity. The emblem on her shoulder would have been a good thing to ask about. She did not know why she didn't recognise it - perhaps it was far too deeply interwined with who she had been - but surely someone else would recognise it.

"You must not tell <em>anyone</em> that you saw me," said the girl shakily. Ariana wondered whether she was a thief, perhaps having stolen the sword, as she certainly did not seem fit to use it. "I can't stop you, but please, <em>don't</em>."

"How long away is the village?" She did not wish to make any promises until the received the information she desired. "How do I get there?"


"I have been walking for four . . . no, five days. The river passes through it, so you'll find it."

Ariana's heart sunk as she considered. <em>Five days</em>? She could not hope to survive until then with no other food with her.

"So . . . ." The girl proceeded uncertainly. "I need to ask you a few questions about what lies further on along the river."

"More river," the answer seemed obvious. "I've been walking for many days myself, and I haven't seen anyone. You're the first person I met."

"Oh . . . ." The news seemed to vex the girl. "I was planning to go there."

"Why would you want to go somewhere where no one lives?"

"I didn't . . . . I mean, I didn't know nothing was there. Are you sure?"

"No. I am merely sure that I haven't found anything."

Ariana paused, observing the confusion in the other's eyes.

"But travellers always go in that direction. I heard them say that they followed the river to get to the town. Maybe they meant the other side of the river . . . ."

"Did you see a path when you first started out?"

"I don't know . . . . I can't remember."

<i>Maybe you were in too much of a hurry running from the village guards</i>, Ariana thought, although she did not voice it. Perhaps the person here could be a useful ally until she was reunited with her parents, assuming she still <em>had</em> parents.

"Do you have any food?" Ariana asked, changing the topic. She had not eaten for days, and the hunger had been constantly on her mind of late.

"Yes . . . . I have some some cabbage left, and some cheese, though not much."

"Could I have some? There's no food either from where I come from."

The girl hesitated, but finally unwound a sack strapped to her side and threw Ariana some cheese. Ariana caught it gratefully, and tool a quiet bite, savouring the rich flavour that she had not tasted in a lifetime. The smell, though . . . . The cheese smelled fresh enough, but a sudden sharp longing overcame her for the one thing she could remember most - <i>deepflower and roses</i>. In an instant she felt willing to lose everything, sacrafice her life for a whiff of the sensation . . . . And then she was back; back in a world that seemed somehow less saturated than before.

"Are you okay?" The girl asked, a worried crease in her forehead.

"I'm fine. Thank you." Ariana finished eating the cheese, and while she was still hungry, the taste of cheese was a welcome change from a completely empty stomach. "Where will you go now?"

The girl turned over the question in her mind, thinking. At last she shook her head in dismay. "I don't know!" She yelled, bordering on tears. "I thought that going here would free me from . . . from <em>all that</em>. Now I'm not even sure I have enough food to get back." She let out a long shuddering breath.

"We could always go to the village . . . ." Ariana suggested. She was sure to make it there with the girl as a guide, and some of that food would not hurt either. That hope was shattered though when the stranger shook her head violently.

"No! We must . . . not go back, not to <em>them</em>," the wailed, panic filling her voice.

"Who? Why should we not return? Is the village in danger?" The reaction made her worried. Maybe she did not meet many people because there was some war afflicted these lands and she was simply unaware?"

"My parents. They would . . . they would kill me if I ever returned, that much I know." She shook her head again, as if rebelling against the very notion. "Or at least marry me off and keep me under lock and key for the rest of my life."

Ariana wondered what the girl had done, but she decided that it was best to wait until later. She hoped to accompany the stranger - maybe she could convince her to at least approach the outskirts of the village.

"What is your name, then?"

"Hesanna Woodproud", replied the stranger. "Just don't tell anyone if you go to the village. <em>Please.</em>"

"I can't go there, unless you give me some food for the road."

"I'm sorry . . . . " Came the uncertain reply. "I would, but then I'd starve myself, and I'm not yet sure where to go. Please, understand."

Ariana did. She herself doubted that she would have given up half her food reserves to appease some haggard stranger.

"Could I . . . follow you?" Said Hesanna. Ariana was surprised - she no longer needed to make the offer herself. "Assuming you're not going to the village, that is. I'm still not going there, no matter what you say. But together we might have better luck searching for a settlement."

Ariana thought about it. The food reserves the girl currently had would not last long, and she knew that she would get less than half of the share. So unless they found more food soon, the only likely outcome remained a slow death. The risk was too great - if she was to follow the girl, they should at least head towards the direction of the village so that they would not get entirely lost. She said as much, and the girl paled.

"But I said that I can't go back, I'm sorry. I really would, but . . . it's too dangerous for me."

<i>More dangerous than starvation?</i> Ariana thought. "At least both of us would not die then. Is there some settlement near the village where it would be safe for us to go? Where you would not be . . . recognised?"

Hesanna thought for a moment. "I remember people mentioning a smaller village west of the town. I did not think to go there . . . . I thought there would be something here along the river, so I went here instead. We . . . could go there, though I don't know how far it is or where it is exactly."

"I'm sure we'll find a road," Ariana turned towards where the girl came from suggestively. "Will you go?"

Another moment of silence, and then a more determined nod. "Yes . . . . We don't have much of a choice, do we. I don't anyway. We will go."

"Good," she nodded.

And with that, the two girls went together north, the scarlet sun slowly descendig behind them.





<h2 id="chapter7">Chapter 7</h2>

Ferming En'Ker was not having a good day. To begin with, he had woken early morning to find his children sick with the sleeping sickness, barely able to string two sentences together. He would have ordered them to help him in the inn regardless, but better judgement made him change his mind - the inn would fall in ill repute if it were known that it had sick workers handling the food and drinks. So instead he had to pay a bunch of farmboys to do the work, who were less competent combined than a lame ox with a drinking problem.

To add to the situation, a fight had broken out in the afternoon between two of the patrons, presumably about a girl. Normally his eldest son would have been there to kick them out to hold the fight outside, but the farmboys simply hid behind the counter until Ferming heard the noise himself and dropped his chores. He ran in to find that many of the decorations on the walls have been destroyed, with the fight still in full swing. He kicked both of them outside on his own, cursing them and yelling that they were never to return to the inn again as they ran off.

"Those revolting cocks," Ferming had muttered to himself, wiping the counter where the blood still remained from when one of the men bashed the other's head against it. At least they did not splinter the wood, like they did with one of the tables. He gritted his teeth angrily, biting into his pipe.

For this reason, he was not interested in amusing the two pennyless riff-raff girls who have invated his inn.

"For the fiftieth time, if you don't go now, I will throw you out myself," he was saying, his face beginning to redden with anger. They have barged in demanding food and supplies for whatever meagre service they could come up with, and when he refused they tried to sell them a bent sword in return. He refused that strongly as well - they likely stole it from someone, and he did not want any trouble - thought why anyone would want to steal a bent sword, her was not sure. "I don't give food to beggars and thieves, and you can't stay in the barn either. I have good horses to house."

However, they did not relent, instead only trying to find new arguments to cheat a fair man of his coin.

"We could sweep the floors at night and tidy the place up," the ugly one was saying. She might have been beautiful, but the haggard face gave her away as just another street beggar up to no good. Her companion looked more plain, and better fed - a thief, he decided, having stolen food and possibly the sword. "When you wake in the morning, the place will be as clean as it had ever been. There are already words outside of how cockroaches cook your food and mice sweep your floors. We simply offer to do you a great service and only ask supplies in return to see us through our journey."

<i>A journey to my purse, no doubt</i>. "I will not leave you alone in the inn at night and to have you sweep the place clean of all my belongings. If you want food, Gregory is offering food to anyone who helps him build his barn, go rob him for all I care. But get out of this inn."

"Gregory wants us to work for a <em>month</em> for the food," the other girl intervened, exasperation thick in her throat. "We can't stay for that long - our master has told us to make haste in carrying out his will."

"What will is that, child?" He asked. If they had a master, one would have thought he'd feed them better. Perhaps he sent them off to get lost in the woods, or, even worse, to rob him. Ferming was not about to believe any wild fairytale thrown in his direction, and this was definitely one of them.

"We . . . ." She hesitated for a moment, either deciding whether to tell him the secret or trying to invent a half-credible story. "We have to deliver a letter to a town in the north," she finally replied. "Our Lord explicitly told us to remain anonymous, so we can not tell you his name or where he sent us. This is as much as we are willing to reveal."

"So can I see this letter, then?" He asked, raising his eyebrows in feigned curiousity. "At least show me that you <em>have</em> a letter, you flaming sow, if I am to believe you."

A moment of silence greeted him, until the girls exchanged uncomfortable looks, telling him all that was to be known about the letter. He nodded slowly. "We . . . we are not to - " one of them began, when he cut her off.

"Get. Out."

At last the girls realised that they have run out of lies. One of them spit on the floor purposefully, and scowled at him before beginning to turn. He scowled back with equal weight, astounded by the attitude. The other went more meekly, though by then he was just glad that they were going.

He was about to turn his back on the pair when one of the patrons exclaimed. "Hey, isn't that the daughter of Pridewood or Woodproud or whatever the lad's name is?"

One of the girls stopped with deliberate slowness, turning to face the man who spoke the words. The other seemed suddenly ready to flee, her face contorted as she looked at her partner with an expression of urgency and pain.

"Aren't ya, lass?" The man - Ferming recognised him to be Vas - looked at the plainer girl with a drunken frown, appearing confused. "Whatcha doing here, girl? Aren't you 'posed to be with yer fadder back at the farm?"

Ferming looked at the pair, suddenly curious himself. Proudwood? They have traded together before on occasion, though the other man never said he had a daughter. They have met purely on bussiness a few times before, and that was that. But why would his daughter be three leagues from the village where Proudwood lived with his wife, begging for supplies like a beggar and looking the part?

The girl did not reply, so Vas turned turned to inspect her accomplice instead. "And who are <em>you</em>? I don't remember seeing you in town. And those clothes . . . . " He paused for a moment, squinting.

Suddenly he stood up from his table, dropping his iron tankard to the ground. He pointed a shaky finger. "Ferming, this lass here is from beyond the Red Sea! What's the likes of <em>them</em> doing 'ere? That picture on her coat. 'Tis of the Queen, I tell ye!"

Ferming's eyes shot open, and he stared at the girl that Vas was pointing at, noticing for the first time the golden pattern embroidered on her shoulder. It was hard to see at the distance, but either way he could not claim to know the embelm of those beyond the Sea. "Vas, are you sure?" He asked slowly, rolling the words with slow deliberation until he was sure even the dimmest of dimwits would understand. Vas had not been a dimwit, even when drunk - not by far. But the matter was too important to make any mistakes.

"Positive, Ferm! Remember the passer-by years ago, claimin' he was a wizard or somethin'? with the hooded cloak? He had a book with 'im and offered me to look, and I looked at the pictures and saw that sign and asked 'im what it was, and he read and explained that it was of the land beyond the Sea."

A drop of sweat ran down Ferming's furrowed brow. "Vas, kiddo," he feigned a nervous smile. "If what you are saying is false, then that is a most serious accusation."

"I am sure, Ferm! The wizard said so! The book did! He read straight out of the book like one of those learn't people do. A <em>book</em> can't be wrong now, cannit!"

Ferming guessed that Vas was right. He remembered the wizard - a <em>druid</em>, he called himself. He had come in one night looking for a room for a few days to rest, and paid generously with foreign copper coin. He had spent all of the days locked in his room, and came out during the evening to drink while scribbling on a page with a feather and looking at some book. Ferming had not seen many books before that moment, so it was sure a sight to remember. Some of the patrons were afraid of him, but the druid paid enough to compensate that five times over.

After a long moment of silence, Ferming had made his decision.

Forcing a strained smile, he spoke at last. "My apologies for the inconvenience. We are but simple folk, and know nothing of the ways of the world. The food is yours, and whatever else you might require. Your master will know that I am loyal to their cause. May the Red Queen live long and prosper."

The girls stared for a moment in confusion, but finally the one in the red suit spoke. "We accept your offer." Ferming released a long sign of relief, and bowed before moving to prepare the items.





<h2 id="chapter8">Chapter 8</h2>

Hesanna was shaking when they finally walked out of the inn, but part of her was satisfied, and another shocked.

That man, Vas - he had recognised her. She did not believe she had seen him before, but her father had spoken to many men throughout the years, and she did not have a good memory of faces to begin with. They needed to get out of the village, though, and she said as much once they were outside. At least Vas did not seem to notice the sword - perhaps he was too drunk, or maybe he simply did not know that it was her father's. Either way, she narrowly avoided being sent back to her parents. She should have known that someone might recognise her, and that mistake almost cost her her freedom. She had to be more careful in the future. <i>Had to</i>.

She felt the bag in her hand, filled with cheese and bread and even some meat. Ariana's bag was identical to hers, filled with the same kind of food. At least they have gotten what they came for, though she was not sure how - the innkeeper seemed almost happy to serve them the goods, smiling a toothy grin and bobbing his head repeatedly as he did so. This was in great contrast to his earlier attitude.

"Why do you think he changed his mind?" She asked. "I mean, he seemed very set on sending us off until he saw the emblem on your coat."

Ariana thought for a moment before replying, staring directly in front of her as she walked. Hesanna was about to repeat the question when the other spoke. "Maybe he feared what this emblem represented. What might happen to him if he did not help us."

Hesanna stared in confusion. "What does it stand for?"

"I don't know."

Hesanna did not reply for a while, thinking herself. "Did you . . . steal the coat?"

"No, it's mine."

"Then how don't you know?"

"I was born in it."

Frowning, she walked in silence, wondering what the other meant. She felt that this was a poetic remark that she was just too dull to understand, so she did not reply as not to show how simple she really was underneath. She had heard poets preaching in the village, and they spoke similarly. Hesanna always thought they just spoke strange gibberish, like the clowns sometimes did, but she was not so sure.

Ariana broke the silence after a short while, anger in her voice. "I was going to rob the sour-looking wretch when he insisted on kicking us out. <em>Flaming sow</em> he called me. Can't say I'm proud of the thought, but he deserves no better." They were passing the last of the houses that comprised the small village, following the road leading east. None of them felt too comfortable leaving the road after the misfortune of following the river.

"It's okay. I understand." How could Hesanna not understand, when she stole the sword of her own father? She had not only stolen it for use, she reflected - she had also taken it as revenge - revenge for forcing her to live the life of a farmer for so many years, for not letting her taste any freedom, for marrying her off to some villager's son to keep her confined. Guilt throbbed at the thought, so she tried to concentrate on the conversation once more. "I would not have argued after that attitude of his."

"Thanks." Ariana replied, her face an expression of deep thought. "I haven't stolen from anyone before, not that I know of, so that would have been the first. I don't feel comfortable breaking the law."

"Neither do I," came the saddened reply. "Though sometimes people just don't have a choice."

"That's strange," Ariana kicked at a rock beneath her. "I don't think I ever knew that before."


<h2 id="chapter9">Chapter 9</h2>

The journey after they left the inn was going slowly than they have initially hoped. The road that they followed was muddy and narrow, and Hesanna would not agree to follow it directly, one of her reasons being the danger of bandits along the road. Ariana chose to agree, so they kept the distance just enough as not to lose track of it entirely, instead walking through the dense surrounding forest. Occasionally they faced a barrier of thick bushes and thorns, and had to compromise with lenghty detours to get to the other side. Perhaps the worst was when they realised that they've lost track of the road, and had to backtrack to find it again.

Each night they found a dry spot among the trees where they could rest, using some of the woolen blankets that the innkeeper had given them for warmth. Each night before sleep they talked until the sun was entirely below the horizon, and Ariana felt that she was beginning to know the other girl considerably more than she did when they have first met. That came with its own surprises - she was astounded by the other's ignorance of even the most basic disciplines such as mathematics, diplomacy and literature. She had not previously known that farmgirls had so little access to education - Ariana had assumed that everyone would at least have a working knowledge of simple arithmetic. Hesanna knew how to count, but the concepts of addition and subtraction were entirely foreign to her until Ariana had given a few examples, though the girl was quick to learn. Their evenings slowly moved from idle chatter to lessons in arithmetic and nations. Ariana tried to delve into algebra, but left Hesanna utterly confused, so she returned to more fundamental ideas.

Her friend was not the only one to learn, however. Ariana never knew of the exact steps to plant a seed or control a herd, and Hesanna's tales of life as a villager enthralled her.

"Why did you never have a Maester teach you?" She had asked, confused.

The tone with which Hesanna replied was equally confused. "Why would a Maester ever teach me? I have never heard of such a word."

It turned out that Hesanna was more familiar with the idea of a <i>school</i> - where a lesser Maester taught many students instead of one - though she had never gone to one. Asked why, she said that it was because her parents believed it to be a pretentious waste of time and coin, which shocked Ariana to disbelief. She did not know for certain whether a Maester ever taughter her, but she could deduce as much as she had been unaware of other means of teaching.

Sometimes Ariana told of the ancient Gods of Toras, Who were said to be part God and part Machine. It was claimed that they created humanity from sand, and that their flames left not glass but flesh and bone.

"Why Toras?" Hesanna had asked, fascinated. "If they are Gods, why would they be from a town?"

"Toras is mountainscape", Ariana explained. "It was lost many thousands of years ago. After the first people declared war on the Gods, when they came with their army, the mountains <em>moved</em> and were no longer where they have been the night before. No one could find them from that point onward, and the people disbanded their armies for the shame of what they have done."

"Why would anyone attack the Gods?" Hesanna was incredulous, her eyes wide open in disbelief.

"The Gods were said to have great power, but refused to share it with the people they created, instead using the power to help whenever help was required. The people rebelled out of greed, feeling that they should become Gods themselves."

While Hesanna was fascinated by the tale, she did not believe it, as it was different from the Gods that she had always known. She explained that how the world is made from innumerable Spirit Gods, who, as a sacrafice of Creation, wove themselves into one intricate pattern that was to be the world. Ariana did not believe that story in return, but to her it did not matter - the Gods were gone, whether in hiding or no longer present, and likely did not care for what anyone believed.

They have also discussed each other's motives for the journey. Hesanna revealed how her parents have attempted to marry her, so she ran away to escape a life of tameness and confinement. Ariana was sympathetic, though she felt that arranged marriage was not far from the ordinary.

In turn she told of how she had woken in the forest with no memory of who she had been before, and how she was intent on returning to her own family and exacting revenge on whoever had done that to her. Hesanna mumbled nervously about how certain roots were said to make people forget who they were, while also granting a sense of pleasure that was outside of what was possible without them. Ariana accepted that as a possibility until the other gasped and told of local drunkards who were known to use such roots. Their teeth have fallen out in the process, and their eyes turned a sickly yellow colour that could not be remedied.

"Do . . . <em>my</em> eyes look like that?" She had asked in deep concern, but gave a sigh of relief when her friend shook her head.

At least she thought they were friends. Hesanna no longer waved the sword at her, and in turn Ariana refrained from making subtle threats at every opportunity. Perhaps not the most pronounced signs of friendship, there was not much opportunity to develop deep bonds on the road. Their conversations were engaging though, and had come to like the other girl.

When asked where they should go, Ariana offered that they should find a city. Surely a city would provide the adventure her companion desired, and would help her unveil the mystery of the emblem on her clothes. Given the reaction of the innkeeper, they might be even given a room at the castle, although she still was not entirely sure why he had reacted the way he did. She had her own hypotheses, but she did not think that she was the type of person who would accept them before first seeking out evidence.

It did not rain for five days after they have set out. Hesanna shared her worries of a drought, but on the sixth day a storm had caught them unawares, fiercer than anything Ariana had known of. They spent the entire day hiding under the trees as rain and ice fell from the sky, propelled by the wind with deadly force until it was falling almost horizontally. A few trees have falled in the distance that day, and they had to resort to sleep in a puddle of mud. After the storm had ceased the following morning, the ground was so wet that walking became a great peril, so they spent another day immobilised until it was dry enough to proceed once more.  

On the eight day they came across a lone farmhouse near the woods. The owner - an elderly man with an exceptionally wrinkly smile - saw them on the road and offered to house them for the night, exclaiming at the dirt on their clothes and the weariness of the two. He did however give a nervous smile upon seeing the sword at Hesanna's side, politely asking her to leave it in the shed. The man gave them fresh clothes and left the ones they were wearing to soak in cold water, explaining that they had belonged to his daughter who had sadly passed away, and then provided them with a hot evening meal while talking about his land and crops and family with melancholy nostalgia.

When the two girls asked him of where they might find a city, the old man simply shook his head. He knew nothing of geography, he had told, and did not travel much. The travellers he sometimes talked to on the road never mentioned a city, and he never asked. They thanked him deeply for his help once it was time to leave again, accepting the food he gave for the road with deep gratitude, and set out once more through the warm summer weather. "If only every man was so kind", Ariana had said with a smile when they were at a safe distance from the hut.

"Then every man would have been robbed and murdered," came the sad reply.






<h2 id="chapter10">Chapter 10</h2>

"What do you mean, you let them walk away?"

Fermer's face was red with anger, fat veins standing out at his temples as he faced the other man with a deadly stare. "What do you think I mean, you flaming pig? I gave them food and let them go, that's what I did! You're speaking as if I had any choice."

The father of the girl stared back in astonishment, unable to find words. Fermer knew that the girls would bring nothing but trouble, no matter what he did. And at last it had come - trouble incarnate, standing at the counter with a cup of ale in his hand. A thick, veined, worked hand that Fermer really had no desire dealing with at that time in the evening. He would have been asleep by now if not the man with his questions, though his own patience was now on a shortening fuse. He did not care for him or his daughter aside from what they traded, and he preferred if it stayed that way.

Fermer was about to tell Woodproud to leave off when the man finally found his words again. He spoke, uttering a single word with cold deliberation: "Why?"

"Because her friend was of the Red Queen, that's why you bride of a rat!" He had not intended to curse at Woodproud at first, but the man was more stubborn than five mules and a pony. He behaved as if Ferming owed him the world - he owed <em>nothing</em> to the man - barging in as if he owned the inn and demanding information. Ferming would have thrown him out long ago if they had not done business at some point, though he admitted that the size of the man did not inspire hasty action. "Do you really expect me to turn away one of her people? If the Queen found out what I had done, there would be hell to pay fifty times over! Have you not heard the tales of what she did to those who stood in her way? The girls said they served a master - I thought they were lying at first, but what if it was Her? Use your head, idiot!"

That did not seem to sway Woodproud at all. "The queen had not been here for centuries, you fool, so better find a different excuse to cover your misdeeds."

"Or what? What will you do, scoundrel? Set my inn on fire? I'll see you do that, I'll have your head for a mop. I did what I had to in order to protect my inn - sad that I can't protect it from the likes of you <em>and</em> them with the same breath. They have not come for a long time don't mean they aren't coming now. She might have stolen the coat for all I know, but to think of it, her face was not <em>right</em>. She did not seem to be from around here - just like you should be if you know what's good for you. <em>Not</em>. <em>Around</em>. <em>Here</em>."

The queen had indeed not sent any men to the nearby villages - not that Ferming was aware of anyway, and he was aware of much with the loose-mouthed travellers who liked to stay at his inn on a regular basis. Some did speak of seeing the Queen's men far off in distant lands - menacing things with metal cages on their heads, riding steel-plated horses in the scorching desert sun - and he could only pray that they remained there.

"If you think that there will be any more business between us," Proudwood began, but the other cut him off.

" . . . Then I'll be the most generous man known to live. Your service was expendable, don't think too much of it. I'm not about to risk raising the Queen's wrath for some scrawny farmer. Your daughter ran away - not kidnapped as you seemt' think. She was more terrified of us knowing her name than she ever was around her friend. Who knows, maybe the Red girl filled her with all kind of lofty ideas. But I don't think you're getting your daughter back any time soon, so either rent a room or stop wasting my time." The last sentence was shouted more than spoken, Fermer's patience running lower than the darkest recesses of the Necrosea. His sons were to return at any moment now, and he had every intention of ordering them to throw Proudwood through the chimney if that was what it took to to make him leave.

"You are a vile man, Fermer En'Ker, a vile man."

"No worse than you. It's your daughter who ran from you, not my sons from me. You beat her, didn't ya? Not sure why else a child would run from their parents if the elders weren't rotten to the bone. Her face might have been clean, but you're too smart for that, aren't ya?"

"I . . . . How dare you . . . ." Proudwood began, but the anger that the accusation triggered was beyond words. He threw his mug at the wall beside Ferming with tremendous force, and the wood exploded in a frenzy of splinters and ale that splattered against the innkeeper's apron, leaving a mark on the wooden wall. "If you ever accuse me of harming my daughter again, count your days numbered."

And with those words, Proudwood turned around at last, his face red with fury. The door closed loudly behind him once he was outside once more, banging against the sturdy doorframe with threatening impact. Fermer sighed with shaky relief, spitting on the floor with contempt. He cursed the day both of them were born, walked to the barrels where he stored some of his drink, and poured himself a large mug of ale.

<i>As if one danger wasn't enough</i>. Ferming cursed loudly, and drank deeply.





<h2 id="chapter11">Chapter 11</h2>

It was not for another week until they learned of a nearby city, and not another two until they finally reached it.

After leaving the old man in his home, Ariana and Hesanna did not encounter another person for at least another five days. The weather had turned sour afterwards, raining every other day with little sun to warm the air, though it had not been anywhere hear as bad as during the storm. When it did not rain, the sky was a solid shade of grey, only occasionally allowing the clouds to dissipate before quickly concealing the sun once more. The weather affected their moods, and not for the best. Hesanna was beginning to wonder whether the road had forked somewhere behind them, with the strain they ended up following leading nowhere in particular. Ariana seemed to share this worry, so that when they finally spotted a caravan upon the road, filled with various merchandice and trinkets, the discussion whether they should approach it was extraordinarily brief.

Once they have managed to convince the trader that they were not bandits, and after they had to explain to him meticulously that they were not interested in his wares, the man was finally willing to listen to the few questions they've had. "What's further up along this road, kind sir? Do you know if a large city nearby? Oh splendid! Where is it located?" The trader proved to be open with his words, answering their questions in great detail. He explained that the road was a lonely place for a traveller such as himself, so answering questions was the least that he could do for two young beautiful girls. Arian
na did most of the talking, given her elaborate way with words, though Hesanna did occasionally interject her own questions.

As it turned out, the road they have been following did indeed lead to a city, though many branchings further on would have led to the uninformed traveller never reaching it. Ariana focused on learning about the city itself, and the man spoke heartily. It's name was Greenfield, he had said, though the green fields have been built over long ago. It was not a large city by any means, but according to him it was larger than all the villages in the area combined, and more crowded too. The Lord of the county resided there in a castle within the city, and crime was virtually unheard of given the multitude of guards patroling the streets.

Hesanna had never seen a city, though she did hear of them. They were said to be places of people and wonder - thousands upon thousands of people living in the same place, sharing both houses and land. That sounded nice to her. In the villages, few ever shared anything with others without an exchange. She had heard that the buildings were high and built together in grandiose unity, and that great towers stood along the great walls protecting the people from bandits and armies alike. The traded confirmed what she had heard of guards - noble men and women hired to protect order and bring justice to those who did not obey it. It sounded like a paradise to her, a blessing of the spirits of the earth. A great part of her teemed with excitement over the prospect of seeing and living in an actual city - something that had only been a dream only a few weeks ago.

The bid the traveller goodbye and good wishes, and he bid the the same. After that, while the weather remained as gloomy as before, their moods were lifted. The journey was no more almost entirely aimless - now there was a goal to consider. Ariana had to go to the castle to speak with the nobles, and Hesanna intended to accompany her. She had decided that as she herself had no clear goal, it was probably best for her to stay with Ariana. If what the other girl suspected was true, reaching her friend's home would be exactly the adventure that she had always dreamt of.

As they progressed, the road slowly became much more populated than it had been before, until not half an hour could pass without a horse cart passing. There were people on foot as well, looking more ragged and hungry than their horsed counterparts. Some were walking in the opposite direction to the two girls, and Hesanna wondered what that could be. Wasn't a city, after all, a wonderful place to live in? She thought that the people meant to return at first, but the sacks they hauled spoke differently.

As the stream of people thickened, the vegetation thinned, dense unexplored forests giving way to large fields of wheat and barley. Most of the land around the road became fenced off, so that the two girls had no choice but to walk on the road directly. By that point Hesanna was more comfortable with the prospect. As there were more people, banditry seemed less likely, and they would not stand out as much as they would have alone on the road. The biggest fact that made Hesanna feel more safe was that they were finally a long distance from her home. She did not believe that her parents would be willing to go looking for her, and at this point, they would hardly be able to find her.

It was finally on the beginning of the third week that they saw the city towers on the horizon, rising above the trees like dark sentinels of justice. The sight gave her renewed strength, and much of the fatigue that had hunted her for the journey seemed to dissipate within moments at the realisation that they have almost arrived. That day the grey clouds vanished at last entirely, and the golden sun warmed Hesanna's skin with delicacy. A gentle breeze swept through the air against their faces, and Hesanna thought that she could feel sense the faint smell of fresh food somewhere far away.

With another half an hour of walking, they were already close enough to the city wall where she could admire the unusual care and regulary with which its stones were placed. The wall must have been ten metres high, lined with thin towers at least thrice the height. Small houses were placed near the wall a considerable distance away, ranging from what looked like the caravans and shacks of traders to larger cottages made from wattle and daub. A stable was located near the gate, though the horses were well hidden behind a large wooden door. Not far from the road was a commotion of traders offering their wares and curious men, women and children gawking over the trinkets on sale. Ariana only shrugged uncomfortably when Hesanna commented on the scene, without saying anything, thought a mention of the size of the city did evoke a faint smile on her face.

Behind the wall itself peeked the roofs of houses - tiled, no straw in sight. Most houses in her village had straw or timber roofs, with only the most important houses able to afford a tiler. Further on within what must have been the heart of the city rose more towers, thicker than the ones on the wall and much higher. Hesanna could only imagine them to belong to the castle that was meant to stand within, which further fuelled her amazement. <i>A city within a city</i>.

As they came closer to the gate, a less welcoming smell slowly crept up to intrude - sewage could be sensed from beyond the wall, though admittedly the smell was not profound. Hesanna frowned somewhat, not sure why anyone would allow waste to accumulate to the point of being perceptible. Back at the farm it was not a big issue, but maybe it was more difficult to manage with people living in one place. On their way Arianna did tell some of what she learned about the functioning of cities, and the impression she took from it was that it was no easy challenge. Hesanna hoped though that this city was well managed - otherwise it would have been abandoned, she was sure.

four guards stood guarding the gate with swords at their sides, and they stopped the two girls as they approached.

"Your city passes?" The less lean of the men asked, extending a leather-gloved hand expectantly.

"Passes?" Arianna said, confused.

"You are new, aren't you?" The guard replied, his voice devoid of any hostility. "Take these papers, and sign this declaration with your names once you have read them. This is a declaration of allegiance to Lord Quart, The Seeker of Truth. Upon your signature, we will issue you with a city pass that will allow you to enter and leave the city. But before I can give you those, I will need to hear your purpose in the city as well. It's for the census, so don't feel too distrusted."

Arianna nodded, and Hesanna shuffled uncomfortably as she was given the declaration. The symbols on the page seemed pretty, but did not look like more than arbitrary squiggles in a neat pattern. Arianna glanced at her, and instantly understood the issue.

"We hereby declare our honesty and allegiance to the Seeker of Truth, Lord Quarth, glory befall her name," Ariana read aloud sofly enough so that few except Hesanna could hear what was being said, while giving the impression that she was reading to herself alone. "To aid in war, and to obey every ruling we thus swear, acknowledging that failure will result in death. We swear to obey the law of the land, and not to engage in work that could be completed by a local subject . . ."

The list went on for quite a while, naming many other rules that Hesanna thought were obvious. When Ariana was finished, Hesanna stared at the blank sheet of crumpled paper issued to her, unsure of what to do. She saw Ariana write something on hers, and looked at her friend with an expression of plea not obvious enough for a passer-by to notice, but clear enough for anyone who cared to look. Ariana noticed this, her face darkening in annoyance, and strode towards her. "<i>Just write anything down and pretend you aren't from here so can't write in their tongue</i>," she hissed, quiet enough for the guards not to hear. Hesanna did so, using her best efforts to forge something similar to what she knew real writing to look like. Ariana looked at the page and nodded reluctantly before raising both their sheets to the guard.

"We have done, sire," she said, bowing her head in a strange way that Hesanna had not seen anyone bow before. The guard looked at Ariana's paper, nodding, and frowned at Hesanna's. "She is not of this land, and does not know the tongue we speak. Please forgive her writing - this is all she knows."

The guard frowned at Hesanna, looking her up and down, and his eyes darted back to the paper before returning to her with suspicion. Finally, he nodded. "Fine, will do. What business do you have in our city? You won't find work here, and trade can be done outside these walls, so why?"

"We are on bussiness from the Queen," Ariana said, her face cold and sober with determination.

"What Queen? Queen Morgareth had died five years past, so not her I'd hope."

Arianna paused, considering. "The Red Queen."

Now it was the guard's turn to pause and stare, his expression matching hers in solemnity if not sobriety. He turned the words over in his head, thinking. At last, he nodded, an air of seriousness about him that had not been there before. "Here is your city pass. You may proceed."

Ariana nodded gracefully. "Thank you." The guards stood aside to make way, unbarring their path to a small doorframe carved in the enormous wooden gate. Hesanna was about to follow her, when the guard held up a hand.

"No weapons allowed in the city. Deposit your sword, and it will be returned to you once you wish to exit."

Hesanna looked at Ariana questioningly, but the other girl just nodded, so she took of her sheath and handed it to the guard, who nodded and waved her past. Hesanna hurried before she could be stopped again, and in a blink she was through the doorframe, walking past two other guards standing idly by the door.

The spectacle that greeted her was nothing like she had ever seen before - the street, while not crowded beyond passage, was bustling with people dressed in a plethora of colours and styles, darting this way and that absorbed in their daily lives. Few bothered to look at the two girls who entered, and those who did gave little more than a darting glance from curiousity. Merchants stood nearby, shouting their wares and attracting visitors. Hesanna laughed, amazed by it all, and how starkly it contrasted to the quiet of her village.

She was distracted by Ariana tugging at her arm with urgency. "We need to go. There is nothing for us here without coin." Ariana began walking, looking back to make sure Hesanna was following.

The farmgirl forced herself to take her eyes off the scene around her, and instead began concentrating on the path in front of her. She had chosen to follow Ariana, and she intended to carry out that decision, even if it meant haste where she only wished to explore and enjoy the surrounding wonders. Their adventure was in full effect, and that alone made her happy.





<h2 id="chapter12">Chapter 12</h2>

Arianna made her way through the crowd of people, evading the citizens with as much grace as she could afford without slowing her progress.

<i>So many markets.</i>

Ever since she had spotted the traders standing outside the city walls at their stands, selling whatever it was they had to offer, a pungent sense of unease haunted her relentlessly. She could not explain why - was it something in her past life, something traumatic? There was no way to know. All that was certain was that she would approach a stall if anything short of her life depended on it.

At first she had buried the feelings, deeming them unimportant. <i>A silly worry</i>, she had told herself, dismissing it with effort. The market stalls within the city renewed her distress, though, making her realise that it might not be as simple as ignoring her emotions the way she found herself able to do. The discomfort ran deeper than mere dislike or worry. It lay at the centre of her mind, gripping her consciousness forcefully and overwhelming her with fear.

Ariana tried to tackle the issue indirectly, thinking of what she knew of markets, and what feelings the knowledge evoked. She knew that markets sold different merchandice - food, jewelry, clothes, suveneurs, perfumes . . . . <i>Perfumes</i>.

<i>Deepflower and roses</i>.

Shaking her head, Ariana shifted her thoughts as a distraction. What she had to do was find the entrance to the inner castle, and speak to whoever was in charge. She was not truly sure what to say, nor what her position with the Red Queen was. She might have indeed simply stolen the clothes in her past life, though that she doubted. She did not <em>remember</em> who the Red Queen was, despite remembering every other detail that was not a deep part of who she had been. That alone was a great indicator of some intimate link between her and the Queen, and was supported by the reactions of others to the emblem on her clothes. No one without great significance would have evoked a response on a comparable level.

After she spoke and found help, she imagined that they would be given a place to rest and recover their strengths after their journey. Ariana was thoroughly tired, and Hesanna complained of the same. They might be given a room in the castle, with servants to alleviate the burdens of daily chores. Once they have rested, they would be given an escort to the Queen, where they would be received warmly.

Ariana knew that this was a naively optimistic prediction of events, but it seemed plausible, so she entertained the notion. She did not know enough to judge the situation rationally - who was the Red Queen? What was the emblem on her clothes? <em>Who was she?</em> The questions floated around in her head, but no answers came on their own. With each day, she grew more and more convinced that her memories would not return to her again. she had not uncovered a single new memory since waking that she was aware of, and close to a month had passed since them. If there was any hope of regaining her past life, it lay in the prospect of the return home triggering the memories that seemed wholly absent from her mind. Until then, the best that she could do was try to patch up the glaring holes in her memory from what she could only indirectly deduce.

When the roads thinned and crowds thickened around them, Ariana grabbed Hesana's hand to make sure that she would not get lost. She was growing tired of looking behind herself at every turn to make sure the girl had not lost herself, and getting lost in a city of this size was a recipe for losing a friend. At one point she stopped, and told Hesanna to meet at the front gate if they got separated, who nodded vigorously in agreement.

As they walked, Ariana began to realise that the city was divided into different districts. They walked through the commercial district, where richer wooden houses lined the streets, the lower floors filled with goods to sell. The people were numerous, mostly consisting of those relatively well-off and the occasional street beggar. Signs hung on both sides of the street, proclaiming the names of the shops that they represented. Ariana was not disturbed by them as she had been by the small markets near the entrance, and her eyes were even attracted to a golden necklance on offer in one of the wealthier stores that had hired mercenaries guarding the entrance. She had no coin though, and even then there were better things to spend it on than expensive decorations. Such things might be useful to a nobel in the courtroom, but not to anyone who intended to ever walk among the common folk without being robbed and beaten blind.

After the commercial district came the poorer houses. These rose higher than the shops, designed to house as many people as could be placed into very little space without putting the area into excessive danger of fire or disease. The wattle and daub houses leaned against each other high above, their tiled roofs almost touching and casting a shadow on the street below. Ariana guessed that tiles were used to help contain outbreaks of fire rather than due to any wealth of the residents.

It took them half an hour more of walking until the proportion of guards to civillians increased, indicating a barracs nearby. The built-up streets did not allow one to see far, so the inner castle wall came suddely and with little warning. Arianna stopped in front of it, noticing how it was taller than the wall surrounding the city, made from bigger stones. Arrow slits lined the upper part of the wall, and she could only guess that the thick towers lining it held up trebuchets and ballistas for defence. There were no buildings leaning against the wall, which was the case with the outer wall as well. Ariana noted the security - if this city were to be attacked, it would not fall easily.

"We should find the gate to the castle," Ariana explained to Hesana. "With our current luck, they should welcome us and offer help, though I can't promise much with what happened to my memory."

Hesanna nodded. "Okay." Ariana felt that the girl was still confused on how one can forget their entire life, especially while remembering everything else. Ariana was confused herself, but in time she hoped that the truth would be unvieled.

They followed the wall right, choosing the direction at random. From what she understood, the castle wall was circular, so they were bound to find the entrance eventually. That did not take long, as within minutes they came across a large stone portcullis separating the outside world from the castle within. The iron gate was raised, but guads stood to stop anyone from entering without permission. Arianna stopped before reaching it, and pulled Hesana aside.

"I'm not sure how to approach this," she admitted nervously. She had thought about it for the last couple of days, ever since they learned of the city, but little came to mind aside from the obvious route.

"Can't we just ask them to let us in, and explain everything?"

"No, they'd find that too suspicious. Anyone with fancy cloth and some sewing skills could come pretending they're of the Queen. We will need to reach those willing to understand before they would be willing to accept the fact that I lost my memory."

"I'd guess so," Hesanna replied with disappointment.

"It might be best if you feign being my foreign friend again. If they ask you to write anything, you'd have an excuse. So don't speak, and pretend that you don't understand what's being said." She waited for the other girl to nod before continuing. "I can try to claim that we have important matters to report, for the council's ears only. That means we will have to hope that there even <em>is</em> a council. But there should be one in a city such as this."

"Like a village council?" Hesanna asked, trying to follow the plan. Ariana could not blame her - the girl had barely even gone to school.

"I would imagine," she said, not entirely sure of the difference. While Hesanna had never gone to school, Ariana guessed that she herself had never lived in a village.

"Okay. So that might work."

Ariana took a deep breath, and nodded. "We should move out then."

They started walking again towards the portcullis, Ariana first with her friend trailing behind her uncertainly. Ariana tried to assume an expression of confidence and regality, hoping that this was what was expected of someone 'of the Queen'. One of the guards saw them approach, and confronted her in a similar fashion to the one near the city gate, although his clothing was a little more sophisticated.

"What is your business in the castle?" Ariana was somewhat dismayed by the tone directed at her. The guard did not seem as civil as the one she had spoken to earlier, despite the obviously higher rank. Perhaps even because of it.

"We have been dispatched by the Red Queen to carry an important message to the Council, for their ears alone." Ariana spoke the words with the conviction of a trained liar, maintaining eye contact with the guard she was addressing.

The guard looked at her curiously, not sure whether to believe her or to send her away. "And where is . . . your escort?"

Ariana paused for a fraction of a second, her thoughts racing. The words began rolling from her mouth before she was even entirely sure of what she was going to say. "The escort is not with us, I'm afraid. They have decided to wait outside the city gates to minimise any disturbance to your people. If you let us through, we shall depart quickly without giving you cause for any more worry."

The guard nodded, and wrote something down in a journal he was carrying before looking back up at her. "Were you explicitly given orders to go here, or is entry an . . . indirect . . . requirement?"

"We were given direct orders to come here," she replied, trying to pick the answer that would increase their chances most.

"Okay, that'd be fine," the guard smirked at her, licking his lips. He pointed at Hesanna. "And who's that behind you?"

"That's my accomplice. We were both given important information to relay," Ariana blurted out before thinking. Wasn't Hesanna meant to pretend to be foreign? Ariana tensed, hoping the mistake would not reveal itself.

The guard nodded. "I see. And what gift have you brought the council?"

The single sentence plunged Ariana into a state of confusion. She paused for a moment, thinking of the most suitable reply. "I am afraid that we have brought no gift."

"Surely you must be mistaken." A dark gleam flashed in the guard's eyes. Was it <i>mirth</i>? <i>Expectation</i>? His other features remained polite and disciplined, but the eyes seemed to leer down upon her. "One does not enter the council with no gift to present. Your superiours would <em>know</em> that."

Her heart sank, unsure how to reply. The way the man spoker to her made her feel as if there was an important detail that she was somehow missing. Why would the council want a gift? The tone with which the guard spoke made little sense. Before she could open her mouth though, the guard continued on, pretending not to notice her struggle.

"To reconfirm, you are of the Red Queen. Do you challenge the point?"

"You are correct. I don't see - "

"Show us your gift, and you may pass without further hindrance."

"We do not have a gift, as I'm sure the council will understand. If they so insist, we shall bring them what they desire after - "


Before she could finish, the guard abandoned all pretense of civility, unsheating the blade from his scabbard. "That's okay, you'll get to see the castle." He raised his voice, bellowing to the men around him. "Lads, I do believe we have two imposters here! They want to see the castle dungeons. Let us help them fulfil their dreams!"

Before Ariana could react with words, the man rushed at her in an attempt to grab her hand. She darted away before she knew what she was doing, evading his clutch by mere centimetres. By the the other guards were armed as well, circling behind them in an attempt to surround the two girls and bar their escape.

"Run!" She screamed, and threw herself back as she was turning before the officer could try to grab her again. She threw out a hand at Hesanna, grabbing the girl by her sleeve, and pulled her with considerable force urging her to follow. Shouts could be heard close behind them, yelling at them to stop and at others to restrain the fleeing figures, but the street ahead of them was only filled with confused citizens trying to stay out of the conflict.

Ariana turned a corner, almost crashing into a procession of choir boys. She dared a quick look behind her, and found Hesanna still following close. Whe she looked back where she was heading though she noticed two women in uniform staring at the strange display.

"Stop them!" Came a voice behind them, and the two guards instantly darted to block the path ahead. Ariana turned again before she could be intercepted, dashing into a narrow alley that had been formed unintentionally by two close buildings. The ground was filthy and stank of sewage, but was not obstructed for the most part. Before she knew it they were once again on a populated steet, pushing past the stream of people that were going about their daily lives.

Ariana ran, her mind racing. <i>Were would be the best place to go</i>? They could not leave the city - the guards would stop them, and even if they did manage to leave there was no going back. They needed a place to hide, but first they had to lose the pursuers.

She turned another corner, running through yet another narrow alley not unlike the one she had previously passed. She jumped over the rotting track lying on the ground, and hit the ground again without faltering. Her blood was beating at her ears, but Ariana barely noticed. The world turned into a heat of speeding objects and heavy panting, a single purpose occupying her mind.

Ariana did not know for how long she had been running when she dared to throw another glance behind her, and to her great relief the street behind was empty save for a group of ragged beggars staring at the fleeing girl. Had she escaped? She dared not risk being caught, so she continued running until her breath finally left her and a sudden wave of fatigue made her slow to a walk. She fell against the wall of an empty alley, panting heavily in a desperate attempt to catch her breath. She doubted that anyone would find her there that mattered, although she wouldn't have been surprised if by morning the whole town would be looking for her.

She glanced at her shoulder, wincing at the glaring identifier embroidered in her coat. If anyone was going to be looking to her, they would not find it difficult if she retained her current clothes. The clothes that have given her a mysterious advantage so far, and now threatened to see her in a dungeon.

Suddenly Ariana jerked up, scanning around her. She had felt that something was wrong, but only now did she become aware of what it was. Where was Hesanna? She had not seen the girl since near the beginning of the chase, when she had first looked around. Trembling, she started walking back, hoping that her friend was not far. But when she turned the corner to face the treet from which she had come, there was no sign of Hesanna.

Ariana walked back towards the alley where she was hiding, and crumpled against the wall, feeling hollow and tired.

Her friend was gone, and she had no idea where.


<h2 id="chapter13">Chapter 13</h2>

Hesanna woke on a cold stone floor, the frigid air sending a chill through her body.

At first it did not occur to her that something was amiss. She had dreamt of fields and starry nights, of travelling with a strange friend that she had found on the road. Any moment now her mother would walk into her room, she thought to herself, and issue her a list of chores for the day to complete in order to earn herself her food.

It was only then that the memories came rushing back to her - of the escape and Ariana and their journey. Of the long days of fatigue they have spent on the road, and the densely built up houses of the city. Of the guards near the portcullis, and the chase that ensured.

And then . . . a flash, and a surge of pain before darkness.

Hesanna tried to move, not having yet opened her eyes, but the motion brought a splitting headache that made her whimper and release her struggle. The pain made her wonder for a moment whether her skull had been shattered by whatever it was that had hit her. Her throat was burning, her lips cracking with dryness. She felt thirsty, but could hardly do much with her eyes closed. She lay there for another few minutes, flowing in and out of consciousness with each new wave bringing ever greater lucidity.

She tried to pry open her eyes, but a yellow light forced her eyelids shut. She tried again, forcing her eyes open with determination. Slowly the light became less taxing, and the scene before her came into gentle focus as her eyes adjusted.

Hesanna found herself lying before a set of rusted iron bars, running along the floor from wall to wall. Beyond was a damp corridor that stretched left and right without allowing her to see far either direction. A torch hung on the wall opposite to her, out of reach behind the bars. It cast flickering shadows that seemed to dance with each feeble flicker of the flames. Aside from that there was little to behold - the walls were otherwise barren, and the floor was empty in her direct field of vision. She looked for water, but could not find any, so there was little she could do to alleviate her thirst.

She tried to move a hand to feel the back of her head, but something stopped her. She slowly looked down and found that her hand was shackled to the wall, secured with a heavy chain. She her other hand, and found it free, for which she was thankful. She brought it up to the back of her head and winced at the sharp pain that flashed through her skull at the most gentle of touches. Whatever they have hit her with, she was probably lucky to be still alive. She tried moving her legs, but found both of them restrained.

Unable to do much, Hesanna simply lay there, shivering and trying not to move her head. A single tear rolled down her face, but she found herself too exhausted and thirsty for more. She closed her eyes again, feeling the torch flicker through her eyelids with a lulling hazelnut glow. Before long sleep overcame her again, and she dreamt of fireplaces.

When Hesanna woke again, littled seemed to have changed - the torch was still flickering away, seeming somewhat brighter than before. She opened her eyes slowly, and saw a tray placed against the floor - on it was some bread and hard cheese and a wooden mug filled with water. She scrambled towards it, ignoring the throbbing in her skull that the movement triggered, and grabbed the mug with her free hand before putting it to her mouth and drinking deeply, barely spilling a drop. Once she was done she gasped, breathing. She did not think that anything had ever tasted before in her life.

Once she caught her breath, she moved towards the food, first eating the bread and then the bits of cheese. The food went quickly, as there wasn't much of it to begin with, but the little that she had helped satisfy the hunger that had been plaguing her since she woke in the dungeon. Once she was done she fell to the ground once more, embracing the hard stone surface feebly, and once again plunged into deep sleep within seconds.

The third time Hesanna woke, the tray before her had been refilled, and she emptied it again eagerly. After she had eaten again, her hunger and thirst were almost entirely gone, and she felt more rested than she had before. Her head was throbbing dully, but at least she could move it again without being immobilised from the pain.

Hesanna sat up, massaging her wrist where the shackle had bitten into her skin while she had been asleep. She took another look at the cell where she was held, for the first time noticing the hinges on part of the iron bars that marked a door. The shackles were not long enough for her to be able to reach the bars - they tray had been placed just close enough for her to be able to reach it. If anyone walked by, they would be in no danger. The mug was too thick to pass through the bars if she chose to throw it, and only the most extraordinary luck would see the tray pass through. Even then, the action would achieve little.

She sighed, seeing no plan of escape. There were no windows, and not even straw on the floor. Her clothes have been switched for ragged trousers and a coat that kept her from freezing while not truly saving her from the cold entirely. There was a draft coming from the corridor - no doubt an air pathway to leave the air breatable.

For the first time she wondered where exactly she might be. Her best guess was an underground dungeon somewhere beneath the castle designed to hold prisoners. What would they do with her? She had heard of prisons in the past. The village where she grew up was too small to afford one. Instead the village council resorted to exiling those who commited crimes, or at times the cutting off of hands or heads. But those were rare occurances. The village was small, and most who lived there stayed for the entirely of their lives. To commit a crime would be to put the family name in disrepute, where everyone would forever remember the crime that one had done.

It was not so in a city, Hesanna supposed. Otherwise there would have been little need for a dungeon. Thinking, she wondered whether there were other prisoners behind the walls along the corridor, just out of sight. Maybe they would be willing to talk to her. Perhaps they knew what would happen to them - when they would be released.

"Hello?" She tried to speak loudly, but the word emerged as a pitiful croak. Swallowing, she tried once more. "Is anyone there?"

Silence greeted her. <i>What if I'm alone here</i>? She thought. She had not seen any sign of people aside from the tray with the food and water. Surely she would have heard someone if they were in one of the adjacent cells, assuming there were any other cells aside from hers.

"Hello?" Louder this time, though less certain. "Is there anyone who can hear me?"


Nevertheless, only silence ensued. She lay back down on the cold stone flood, thinking about what had happened to her. What had she even done? She only came in search of adventure, following Ariana to the city. Why would they imprison her? The entire situation felt unreal to Hesanna. When she left, she had not imagined that she would become a criminal, but now it seemed that she had become one twice.

Curling up, succumbed to the crying that had threatened to overwhelm her the entire time, and time lots all its meaning.






<h2 id="chapter14">Chapter 14</h2>

Ariana put on her new clothes, part of her mind reflecting on the dullness of the cloth and thinness of the fabric. The merchant that had sold it to her said that what he was giving her was of the highest quality in Bryne - if that was so, it was a wonder that all the other people wore more than rags and bushes.

She had given her previous attire in exchange for the cheap garb, hurrying before news spread of the Red Queen pretender. Let the unfortunate soul who would choose to wear it next handle the accusations of pretense. She <em>was</em> a pretender, for all she knew for sure, but no one would understand - or believe - her loss of memory. She was somewhat saddened to part with the cloth, reflecting on the benefits that it had brought them earlier. But it was far too dangerous to wear it now.

<i>Them</i>. The next day was spent scouting for information. <i>Who was the Red Queen</i>? The question was laughed off nervously, and she was told to not ask stupid and dangerous questions. <i>Where were prisoners held</i>? Two innkeepers chased her off their establishments when she asked, and some men on the streets said that prisoners were hanged, not fed. It was not until she spoke to a local drunkard that he confided to a dungeon beneath the castle that was less known than the gallows.

"Eye, I've seen it myself, I have," he had said, his voice scarred by alcohol. "Those scoundrels 've 'cused me of stealing whiskey from the taverns, but the owner asked to spare me hand, as I still worked for him you know. So they locked me up in that place for a few weeks to sober me up." He chuckled with a toothless grin. "Those guards kept me well watered, though, secrets be kept. I knew of some things they've wanted, that they would-"

Ariana had to interrupt the old man, sensing a lengthy story unfolding. "Do you know how one may get in there?"

The man laughed. "Eye! Get hired at a tavern and steal their cursed whiskey, that's how! You might also try your luck kicking a guard - if you do lass, I owe Sam Steverti such a service - but half of them could slice you on the spot, and the other two halves could hang you after. Although sometimes you don't have to do nothing at all! Ask my friend Pier, if ya will. He got put in there even though he-"

Ariana listened patiently for a lengthy twenty minutes, asking pointed questions until she realised that the man was of no further use. She thanked him goodbye and pretended not to hear his claims of payment as she lost herself within the crowd - a silent shadow in plain view.

By midday, she was starting to wonder whether she could have haggled for additional payment for the clothes she disposed of. She was growing hungry, and she knew that night was approaching. She could hardly sleep outside as they have in the countryside. Not even the beggars dared lie unprotected in the dark.

//note to self: citadel = internal castle

The rest of the day proved relatively fruitless in terms of gathering more information. No one was willing to tell much about the prisoner dungeons, and Ariana could not ask much without arousing obvious suspicion. She could not ask much about the Queen either, as news might spread of the Red Queen pretender changing clothes. Even if they did not, it would likely see her a target of the guards patrolling the town, so she kept the questions to a minimum.

Instead she chose to search for the library, hoping that it might yield the information she desired. Few of the townspeople seemed to know of where the library was located. Little more seemed to even <em>know</em> what a library was, to her surprise. She had more luck in the richer districts, where the inhabitans seemed more educated in contrast with the rest of the city. Some referred her to the inner library in the Citadel, though warned her that only a select few had access to the books. Most simply scowled at her in disguist, telling her to leave her alone with her beggar's tricks. A select few however spoke of a less well-known library at the edge of the city, maintained by an old knight who had retired to found a life of study.

No one knew where the library was, but locating the it took no more than a few hours. The occasional question - asked in the casual light of curiousity and a love of learning - slowly directed her to the large building. The library stood between houses somewhat small in comparison with the rest of the town, and in itself it was not much bigger. Painted wood supported a tiled roof, and a modest door guarded the entrace to the place of knowledge.

The small size of the building made Ariana dubious. Would she really be able to find much in a place that could hardly contain more than a few hundred books? Her notion of what a library should be like encapsulated places with endless shelves of book about every topic possibly imaginable. This felt to fall short of half a shelve of what she knew a library could contain. 

Nevertheless, when she entered she found that the dusty old building's walls were entirely covered with books - many more than the exterior suggested. An elderly man was standing near the door, his eyes shadowed by a pair of impossibly thick glasses. He gave her a suspicious glance, eying her up and down before standing up to approach her.

"Hello, young lady," he said, his voice kind yet his eyes exhibing readiness to act at any possible discrepancy of good conduct. His muscular arms were folded at his chest, the calloused hands hinting at a toilous life not too long past. "Has someone sent me a letter again? Or why are you here?"

Ariana straightened, looking him in the eyes with ice-cold dignity. "I have come, for I have heard that you house is a library, containing the vast knowledge of both the past and the present. Is that true?"

"Aye girl, that is true. Why would anyone at your age care for reading, books above all? Can you even <em>read</em>?"

She took a deep breath, momentarily confused by the attitude before recalling the dirty rags she took for her clothes. She quickly produced a response designed to distance herself as much as possible from the girl she knew the guards might be searching for. "Yes, I can read. I have lived in this city for my entire life, and am curious of its history. The architecture amazes me most, if mainly for its utilitarian genius. I thought that it might benefit my education if I were to learn more of this town from the wisdom of those greater than me."

The man looked at her suspiciously, considering. "Well you sure don't speak like local, never mind the commoner you're dressed as. But I suppose that's no business of mine." He walked down to his desk, and gently lifted a thick volume with a bookmark stuck loosely between the pages. He opened the book, and handed it to her. "It's not to uncommon that the local riff-raffs come in here to steal some of my books. They have never succeeded," he gently motioned at the sword propped against the wall not far away, "but if you can at least prove you read, your words will hold more weight."

Ariana carefully took the book from him. The paper was yellow and old, thinner than what she knew paper should be like. Focusing on a paragraph, she began reading aloud, the words coming fluidly and without hesitation. When she was done, the man nodded, hiding mild surprise.

"Well, your clothes are definitely deceiving, young lady, no offence. Please, welcome, and apologies for the questioning. I treasure my books, so you'll understand. Follow me." He started towards the stairs, but made brief detour to take his sword from its place by the wall and sheating it before continuting upstairs. There, the books were even more numerous than could be seen near the entrance, with bookshelves that rose from floor to ceiling assorted with books much older than what she could recall from memory. "The name's Jacque, for courtesy's sake," he said, not stopping to address her.

"Elizabet," Arianna answered politely.

"What brings you to the library now, and not before? It had been open for a few years now, as you know."

She thought for a moment, thinking what to reply. Ariana wished that she could just tell the truth the entire time, not to lie to even those who have chosen to assist her, but the danger seemed too immense, and her instinct too strong. <i>Surely no harm would come from such an innocent lie</i>, she thought to herself as her imagined life story unfolded in her mind. She might not have a past that she knew of, but she was certainly capable of inventing her own.

"My esteemed mentor suggested that I learn the ways of the common folk, and spend some time amongst them. Meanwhile I have heard of your private library, and felt that it would be an awful opportunity to waste if I were to return to my mentor without learning more of the history of the city. I'm sure that he will be proud once I show him my knowledge." She smiled as she finished her sentence, feigning affection for her supposed mentor.

"I see," came the simple reply.

No further questions were asked on their brief journey through the corridors, and before long she found herself in an airy room with a few unshuttered windows and wooden stools to sit on. The librarian - no, <em>Jacque</em> - walked towards a bookshelf near one of the windows, and waved his hand at it ceremoniously. "You have mentioned a history of the city. The top three shelves speak of that, and more. I'll have to leave you here, but there's no other exit save for the front door, so I'll see you if you chose to leave."

The man was about to turn to leave when Ariana's hand darted up in a question. "Sir! Outside interest fascinate me no less. My mentor did not teach much of the ways of the world, and I do wonder - do you have any books related to the surrounding lands? I have often seen travellers come and go, and their stories fascinated me to no end, surely - "

Jacque cut her off with a raised hand of his own, and closed his eyes briefly before replying. "Yes, there's a bookshelf above dedicated to foreign affairs. If you speak to me downstairs, I will lead you to it." With those words he turned at last, and walked away towards the stairs, leaving her alone with all the books in front of her.

Before Ariana approached the bookshelf that Jacque had pointed her to, she quickly looked through the other books on display, curious of what they might contain. One shelf seemed to be filled with detailed discussions of the sciences, complete with various diagrams, though when she opened a withered book on medicine she found the material horribly oudated. Another shelf was dedicated to the art of alchemy.

Overall there did not seem to be any special books on display, so she gave up and instead chose to focus on the bookshelf to which the librarian had directed her. She looked through the volumes, and they were indeed focused on the history of the city. <i>Novaris</i>, it was named. She picked up a stack of books, and set them by the stools, skimming through them without focusing on many details.

The main quest of her search was to find a map of the citadel, or anything that would help her find her way into the the dungeons without being seen. Hesanna must be there. There was no other place they would put her, and her crime was surely not severe enough for a public hanging. Ariana had walked past the main gate a number of times, blending in with the crown and searching for her friend where they have agreed to met, but she did not find her. That meant that either Hesanna was not released, or the girl just happened not to be there at those particular times when she visited the gate.

Regardless of where Hesanna was, if she managed to infiltrate the Citadel and speak to the council without being detained, they would likely help her locate her friend if she found a lie good enough to persuade them.

The thought crossed her mind to abandom Hesanna, leaving her to find her own way through the system, but the thought was dispelled before it could assume enough form to be even considered. Hesanna was in trouble because of her, and she liked the girl. She was not about to let all those nightly lessons on the road go to waste because of some unfortunate misunderstanding. And even then, Ariana had a sense of honour that made the idea revolting to the essence of her very being.

After a couple of hours of searching, the sun was already approaching the horizon, making it difficult to read under the poor scarlet light that found its way into the window. Most of the books that she had found seemed generally useless - some were fairy tales based in the area, prolifirating wild claims of goblins and ogres who have lived in the city in the early days when it was little more than a few scattered houses and a caravan. Other books held more merit in realism, but were entirely irrelevant - historical accounts of trade and produce, the diaries of travellers before there even was a citadel, a detailed account of a battle that had presumably been fought in the city. Less than half the books were even set within the last century, and she quickly learned how to distinguish them from their older counterparts based on the state and style of the cover.

The little information that she did manage to gleam was that the citadel was built six hundred years ago by invades who have conquiered the city. After the battle, the victors decided that the victory was far too easy to accomplish, and commision the citadel to be built to protect them from any retaliation by the neighbouring kingdoms that have reigned at the time. The citadel was later upgraded to fit it with towers and further defences, giving the additional benefit of long-range weapons to aid the swordmen.

Aside from that, only one book mentioned the prison in the dungeon, stating that the author thought it somewhat larger than the prisons he had seen in other cities. The crime rate was noted to be high, and the dungeons often full, but the majority of the book regarding prisons was dedicated towards the lamentation of no secure tower room to contain high-ranking 
prisoners.

Ariana had gone through only half the shelf when the creeping darkness finally proved too dense to read further, and she closed the book she was holding in defeat after sighting mention of spirit hounds roaming beneath the walls at night. She placed it back where it belonged, and coughed as she wiped the dust off her clothes that had accumulated from the books. Only half the books were particularly aged - the others seemed merely old from disuse. Whatever the old knight's collection, he was either overly cautious or his library was simply not popular with the locals.

When she walked down the creaking stairs, Jacque heard her before he saw her.

"Have you found what you were looking for?" He asked, mild suspicion in his voice.

Ariana found it to be one of the few instances where truth was more benefician than a lie. "No, I haven't," she sighed.

"Hmm, how come? I've read the books myself, and you can learn almost everything about the city from what one may find there. Onless of course you've not read them all and wish to return later."

"That would be highly appreciated," she said, forcing a faint smile.

As if reading her mind, Jacque asked her the question she was unsure of herself. "Where will you go now that it's getting dark? I'm not sure the streets are a safe place to walk through in the evening. Would't your mentor have warned you against that?"

Ariana hesitated. "He did, but I thought that pleasing him with the knowledge would be more important. I have to go back to his care in less than two days, and since I still haven't found what I have been looking for . . . I thought this might be my only chance." In truth, she had become so engrossed in her study that she had barely noticed the setting sun casting the shadows around her. Other than that, she didn't actually have anywhere to go - she would have likely ended up wandering the streets in the darkness anyway, unless she found some small crevice to hide in while the night passed. She did not say any of that, however - the less linked her to the girl of the Red Queen encountered by the guards, the better.

Jacque nodded slowly, as if wondering how to react to her mistake. "So where will you go?"

"I have a room at a tavern in town," she quickly said, going for the obvious answer that she had previously planned. "It is a well-reputed establishment, and not far from here. I'll be safe once I am by the warm hearth of its fireplace."

"Its fireplace, huh?" The man soodenly jolted into motion, not directly towards her but instead to stand between her and the door leading outside. He faced the book shelf in front of him, closing his eyes and caressing them with the fingers of one hand. "Look girl, I know you've been lying to me this entire time, but I didn't know just to what depths your lies reached. Now I'm fairly sure."

Ariana froze, looking at the librarian with momentary shock before regaining her regal composure. "I don't know what you're talking about - " she began, but Jacque cut her off.

"There are very few mentors in the citadel. I should know, I served as a knight there for many years before my retirement." Part of Ariana's composure faded into volatile alarm, her cheeks suffusing with the faintest hint of rose. "Even if you were indeed who you claim, their service is restricted to only the highest nobility who would never be permitted to leave the citadel grounds if their mentors whished to keep their heads. You might have passed for a foreigner, helped by that almond skin of yours, and yet you claim to be from the city."

Ariana didn't know how to reply. The same feelings swarmed over her that she had felt when the guard caught her at her lie - panic, failure, <em>guilt</em>.

"Now you speak of hearths! Have you not lived here for a second? There were no hearths in the city since the great fire fifty years ago. Anyone caught with a hearth would be executed, so you'll least of all find them in a tavern. Now I ask again, <em>where will you go now</em>?"

Ariana stood there, her mouth open. There was no way for her to deny her guilt, so she did not even attmept.

Instead, for once, she told the truth.

"I don't know."

Jacque nodded in approval.





<h2 id="chapter15">Chapter 15</h2>

Hesanna did not know for how long she had waited when she heard footseps once again, but this time two pairs - two people walking in the corridor.

She tried to sit up from lying for too long, and found that she was barely able to sit up. The thirst and hunger had renewed themselves, and assaulted her with more viciousness than before. She stared at the torchlight before her, forcing her eyes open to make her eyes adjust faster. When the two dark figures came to occlude it, while she could not make out their faces, she did spot the tray on the hands of one of them, and her mind lept with expectation.

The other figure approached the iron door, and after the sound of keys it swing open, creaking on its rusted hinges. The figure entered, carefully remaining out of reach, and looked down upon the sitting girl. Its face was shadowed, and difficult to make out, but Hesanna could easily make out the metal helm around the figure's head.

"Who are you?" The voice belong to a woman that was beyond the prime of her youth, but yet young enough to retain the power of maturity.

"I am Hesanna," she croaked, barely managing to pronouce the words. Her throat burned with thirst, making talking a non-trivial endeavour.

The figure hesitated, and waved over her accomplice with the tray. She took a mug of water from it, and handed it to the girl. "Drink this."

Hesanna drank, gasping at the refreshing taste of clean water. When she was done she set the empty cup down on the floor, panting.

"Now that that's dealt with, why are you here?"

Hesanna thought, confused. Why <em>was</em> she here? "I don't know," she replied truthfully. When tense silence stretched in reply, she scrambled for more details. "I was running and then . . . darkness. Someone hit me on the head." She moved one hand to the back of her skull, feeling the bruise. It hurt less, though not did not show any other signs of improvement.

Her interrogator thought for a moment, and nodded. "Why were you running?"

"I was being chased . . . by guards. So I ran . . . " She paused again, unsure of what to add, when the woman slapped her with a gauntled hand.

"Don't take me for a fool, you wench," she said in a harsh tone, all the gentleness vanishing from her voice in a mere instance. "Now I ask again, and next time I won't be that nice. The Questioned did not receive his weekly serving of prisoners this week, so I'm sure he'd love to make up for it on you. Now, <em>why did you run</em>?"

Hesanna panted, trying to control her panicked breath. She steadied herself shakily. "They chased us after we tried to enter the city inside the city. They wanted a <em>gift</em>." She was still confused about the matter. Why would anyone chase them for a <em>gift</em>? It made no sense to her, so she presented the fact as plainly as it was in her mind.

The information did not seem to surprise the woman. "'We'. Who was with you?"
---
Hesanna hesitated. Would she be betraying her friend if she told? She decided to only say as little as was demanded of her. Hopefully that would be enough to spare her from the threats made by the woman.

"She was my friend," she said plainly. "I didn't know her for much, so there's not much that I can say."

"Why were you in the city?"

She sighed, partly from relief. There did not seem to be any need to reveal more about Ariana. At least for now.

"We've come here to find work," she lied, uncertainty on her face. When the woman started moving towards her threateningly, she sprang back. "Okay, we came here because we wanted to see a city, I promise! I just followed her. She said that she wants to find out more about herself because of her memory, so I . . . I . . . . " Tears slowly began streaming from her eyes. She was painfully aware of the blame she was putting on her friend, but if she did not speak the truth, the woman might <em>kill</em> her. She sagged in defeat. If she had any shred of courage left in her, it was hiding somewhere deep below in the basement of her mind.

This answer satisfied the woman more. "What is her name?"

"Ariana," she blurted, regretting the word before she even finished uttering it.

the woman took out a quill and a notebook, and scribbled something down. "Why did you pretend to have been sent by the Red Queen?"

"I haven't! Ariana had the idea. I merely followed. She said she was one of the Queen's people, and wanted to find out more. She only wanted to speak to the council to ask questions. Her memory was lost . . . . Please, I'm telling the truth!" Before the end of the sentence Hesanna was a sobbing mess, unable to go on. The woman looked at her with an expression of pity and disgust, and motioned for the other figure to lay down the tray with food and retrieve the empty one. Before long they were gone, and Hesanna was once again alone in the cold damp cell. But this time, the hunger was supplemented with piercing guilt and shame.





<h2 id="chapter16">Chapter 16</h2>

Ariana woke in a soft bed, covered by a myriad of thin yet comfortable blankets. For a brief moment she was confused. She had not had such a comfortable night since when she could remember. She then recalled the library and Jacque, and relaxed.

On the evening when he caught her at her lie, Jacque made her stay and explain herself to him until he had been satisfied. She found that once she had began, the truth unrolled from her mouth like a ball of yarn until she had revealed no less that everything of what she knew herself.

Once she was done she questioned the decision, wary of the stranger, but he simply nodded and offered her a bath and a bed in a spare room. The kindness confused her, but he did not seem like he intended to surrender her to the authorities, so she accepted it cautiously. When she asked by, the man shrugged. "Even if you're a filthy liar," he had said, "anything less than lies would have shown you more foolish than you seem."

After she woke, she did not immediately rise from the bed. Instead she lay there, conteplating. Will the retired knight kick her out now that she was awake again? If that had been his plan, he would have let her leave the night before and not bothered with the kindness of a place to sleep. What was she to do? Part of her mind wanted her to sneak away and flee without being see, but to leave without thanking would have been a rude gesture. And even then, she had still an interest in the small library's book collection. If she were to leave, there would be no hope of her gleaming the books ever again, and her entire visit would have proved less than pointless.

Ariana stood up, and went to wash her face in the basin inside. The water was cool and refreshing - something that she did not have an opportunity to feel from when she could remember. She wiped her face with a towel, and went downstairs. The book shelves seemed to dominate the first three floors of the building, while the fourth was only used for sleeping and daily living by the librarian. She did not intend to leave, but Jacque had likely woken long ago. 

She found the man sitting by the counter near the entrance, hunched over the book he had made her read from on the day before. He did not look up immediately upon hearing her presence, but read until a certain point before placing a bookmark between the pages and closing the book. He looked up at her curiously, remaining seated. "If you wish to leave, I can not stop you."

Ariana considered, but shook her head. Part of her still wanted to flee, but she stood by her decision.

Jacque nodded, and glanced at the door briefly. His library did not seem to have too many visitors, and the space behind his counter was filled with an assortment of books and trinkets that he likedly used to pass the time. Ariana would not have been surprirsed if he thought of visitors as guests who came into his home to admire a private collection.

"I still need to speak to the council," Ariana said. She had told him of the Red Queen, and her plan to get help from the city.

Jacque's expression soured a notch. "And what have you got to prove who you are?"

Ariana considered, but could not answer. She had hoped that her clothes would sway the council, but was convinced that she would find another way when she traded them for safety. No other way came to mind, save for the generousity of the council members.

"I still need to find my friend at least."

"The cellars are not as hard to get into as you might think. The harder part is getting out, especially with a prisoner."

That much Ariana knew herself, but she was not sure what else she could do. Their plan seemed to have been going relatively well until they have entered the city, where the simple plan was complicated by a lie.

"When we have tried entering the citadel, they spoke of a gift, and chased us when we did not have one. Why?"

Jacque thought for a moment, considering whether to explain. "I'm not sure I should be telling you this, girl. It's no secret, but no common knowledge either. Have you ever heard of the Topology Treaty?" Ariana shook her head. "Each great city has a set of gifts that they must give if they are to send ambassadors to each other. The gifts vary based on which city approaches which, and there are some other . . . security measures. They help ensure that embassadors are indeed who they claim they are. When you walked through these gates without the tailored gift dressed as you were, you essentially announced that you were not only not who you claimed to be, but also that you likely murdered the <em>true</em> embassador and took their clothes. The gifts were designed to be non obvious, so that an ignorant bandit would not care to carry it."

Ariana stared. She had not known of the existence of such rules, or that there even <em>was</em> some established protocol for sending ambassadors.

"Come, follow me," Jacque stood up, and walked towards the stairs once more. Ariana followed. He led her to a spacious room on the second floor, where he motioned for her to sit in a chair. "Wait here, It'll just take a moment."

Ariana seated herself, and waited. Before long Jacque returned with a pile of books that he placed on a table beside her, before storming off again in search for more. Ten minutes later came the final batch of books.

"These describe everything you need to know," he said, pointing at the diverse array of books laid out in front of her. Some were old, but most seemed recently written, their pages whiter than the rest. Upon further examination Ariana discovered that many of the books were printed, so the date of writing was unknown. "When you are done, you should have a better understanding of what you are dealing with. Perhaps the next time you lie, you will actually lie more believably than you have at this point."

"Thank you," Ariana said, and the librarian left, leaving her alone with the books. Ariana picked one up, and began researching.
